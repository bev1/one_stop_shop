							<h2><span>Obtaining a Residence Permit</span><br class="d-none d-lg-block"/>in Europe</h2>
							<p><strong>The answer to the question "Where can I obtain a residence permit most easily?" </strong>depends on multiple factors: expenses, time spent, trust of the authorities, conditions for obtaining, income from investments, and prospects of obtaining a second citizenship. The standard of living in the country is of importance too as well as whether it's easy to adapt to this particular country.</p>
							<p>
								There are absolutely legal, affordable, and in some countries cheap, ways to get a residence permit in Europe. It's up to each to decide where the procedure is the easiest and cheapest, depending on their own goals and resources.Countries that offer to obtain a residence permit for real estate investments are a win-win option.</p>
							<p>It's also worth remembering that, because of the easy movement within Europe it provides, <span>obtaining a residence permit in the Schengen Area </span><strong>is the best option.</strong></p>

								<p>Real estate yield is higher than that of other financial instruments (government and corporate bonds and deposits). Additionally, real estate yields may be comparable to or even higher than stock yields</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent2">
								<p>Shares and bonds may lose their value completely. With real estate, this can only happen if the building has been completely destroyed or the location becomes uninhabitable.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent3">
								<p>Volatility is an indicator that characterizes the mutability of price. The volatility of real estate is lower than that of other financial instruments because real estate transactions are conducted in the private market and are less liquid.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent4">
								<p>Income from bonds and shares is fully subject to income tax. Real estate makes it possible to deduct depreciation from the tax base, while the market value of the real estate object does not change.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent5">
								<p>Normally, real estate follows inflation. Standard lease agreements provide for annual indexation, which may be expressed as a fixed percentage or equal to the consumer price index. When selling apartments, the price, with stable demand, grows with inflation.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent6">
								<p>Investment in real estate has potential for value growth through possible improvements (e.g., renovation, new construction, or management optimization). The value of real estate changes during market cycles. Thus, the time of selling is a key aspect of value maximization for an investor.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent7">
								<p>Investments in commercial real estate usually involve stable cash flows in the form of leases, which are distributed through dividends on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent8">
								<p>If bank loans were used to finance the real estate object, rental income will help to service the debt payments. They will reduce the debt burden and thus increase the equity capital, which the investor floats at the time when the real estate object is sold. With financing cheaper than using equity capital, the investor will be able to earn some money thanks to the difference between the cost of the equity and debt capitals.</p>

To increase the profitability of your investment, you can sign a contract with a company that provides commercial real estate brokerage services. In the course of the transaction, the owner transfers the property to third parties who will do their best to increase the profitability of the real estate object.</p>
