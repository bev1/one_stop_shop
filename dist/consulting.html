												<p>Foreign organizations do not have to pay taxes on the territory of Dominica. However, you will certainly need to transfer the annually duty. The payment is made every year, but no later than the day of registration of a legal entity. If you do not follow this requirement within this time, the company will be expelled from the Register. However, the cost of the duty in Dominica is only $ 100, therefore, the  payment will not cost the Earth for the company owner.</p>
												<p>If you haven't paid duty in time, you can quickly and easily return the company to the Register. It is enough just to pay off the debt in duty and fines. Nevertheless, the name of the organization will have to be changed anyway. If you need to use a specific name, you can make re-registration of a legal entity with the same name.</p>

												<p>The state has become an offshore zone due to the terrible economic situation, cased by the depletion of the main resource – phosphates. The legal base was formed earlier. </p>
												<p>Offshore relations are regulated by legislation from 1992. The International Business Companies Act is the basis of the country's jurisdiction. At the same time, all conditions have been established for the formation and development of international corporations.</p>
												<p>There is the requirement of registration in the form of International Business Companies (IBC) in order to establish an offshore company within the jurisdiction. The establishment of a holding or a commercial corporation can take up to two days because the system is very flexible.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent32">
												<p>The government has developed the most favorable conditions for offshore companies, however, any kind of fraud can be punished. If the company is suspected of this, it can be easily liquidated.</p>
												<p>Thanks to that, the country received recognition as an offshore zone. The jurisdiction allows the anonymous registration. Consequently, the founder can keep a low profile, entrusting the leadership to the formed staff.</p>
												<p>The regulation of corporate relationships is also envisaged. They are guided by the following acts:</p>
												<ul class="tab-list">
													<li>The Corporations Act (1972);</li>
													<li>The Insurance Companies Act (1974);</li>
													<li>The Bunking Act (1975).</li>
												</ul>
												<p>At the same time, there has been formed the authority that controls the implementation of the interaction norms prescribed in the legislation. The government has formed a group of 10 agents who control the activities of the corporations. As their powers are intertwined, agents often compete with each other.</p>
												<p>Some factors should also be attributed to features.</p>
												<ul class="tab-list" style="list-style: none">
													<li>1. The IBC's area of interest can include any activity that is not prohibited by law. However, certain areas require a license permition. These are banking, trust, insurance and reinsurance.</li>
													<li>2. You can get a list of offshore registration in Nauru within two weekdays. In this case, the countdown begins from the moment the package of documents is submitted.</li>
													<li>3. The name of the company can be registered in any language, but there must be an English translation. The originality of the name is also important.</li>

												<p>The offshore jurisdiction of Labuan is gaining popularity not just because of its advantageous geographical location, but also due to the most extensive list of treaties that exclude double taxation.</p>
												<p>At the moment, more than 60 banking institutions are registered in the state, as well as many insurance, leasing, trust firms. Bahasa (Malaysia) is the official language on the islands, but English is also widely spoken.</p>
												<p>The currency of Labuan is the ringgit, but it is not allowed to make a deal in the local currency for the offshore companies in most cases.</p>
												<p>State legislation provides an opportunity to register enterprises of various forms of organization with diverse degrees of responsibility. These two types of companies are the most profitable for the foreign investor:</p>
												<ul class="tab-list">
													<li>closed-type;</li>
													<li>open-type.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Closed-type companies are characterized by minimum permissible capital of 2 ringgits and maximum number of 50 shareholders. They are allowed to transfer shares to a third party (or several parties) in free form, as well as to issue credit funds to the directors or other firms.</p>
												<p>Moreover, organizations of this type are exempt from handing down the balance sheet of theirs activities in Malaysia.</p>
												<p>Open-type companies can also be registered on the state exchange and allow shareholders to transfer shares to third parties.</p>
												<p>However, the distinctive features of the open-type companies  are an unlimited number of shareholders and the minimum capital amount of 20 million ringgit, which must be paid in full by the time the company is registered. Such organizations are required to have auditors for reporting to the recorder authority in Malaysia.</p>
												<p>All types of companies registered in Labuan must have a package of documents, consisting of:</p>
												<ul class="tab-list">
													<li>Memorandum of Association;</li>

												<p>The most common and popular type of organization in Singapore is the private limited liability company.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent182">
												<p>The main requirements are the following:</p>
												<ul class="tab-list" style="list-style: none">
													<li>There must be at least one shareholder for registration: an individual or legal entity (a resident or non-resident of Singapore);</li>
													<li>the number of shareholders in a limited liability company cannot be more than fifty people;</li>

												</ul>
												<p>A minimal capital amount is one Singapore dollar. There is no unregistered authorized capital in the Singapore legislation, a paid-in capital only. The bearer shares are prohibited.</p>

												<p>The organization must appoint auditors within three months of the company establishment, unless the organization is not required to be audited (if one of the shareholders is an individual and/or if the company's turnover for the year does not exceed five million Singapore dollars).</p>
												<p>There is a regulation for the necessity of an annual shareholders meeting, wherein, the first session should be held within eighteen months from the date of the company establishment. Thereafter, the term between meetings cannot be more than fifteen months.</p>

												<p>Futhermore, there is no capital gains tax in Singapore. The tax resident status will directly depend on the place where the organization is controlled and managed.</p>
												<p>Residents and non-residents taxation are the same, with the exception of the residents right of avoiding a double taxation according to the agreements, and exemption from taxes on income, received from the foreign sources; participation in a tax exemption program for a part of income received in the first three years of the organization's activity.</p>
												<p>The standard income tax rate is seventeen percent. Resident individuals whose income is up to one hundred thousand Singapore dollars per year (during the first three years of business) are exempted from paying income tax.</p>
												<p>For taxpayers whose income does not exceed two hundred thousand Singapore dollars per year, the rate of income is eight and a half percent. Nevertheless, the organization must have no more than twenty shareholders, ten percent of which are individuals. </p>
												<p>The organization undertakes to submit the income tax returns  with the waybill documentation by December 1 of each following the fiscal year. </p>
												<p>Moreover, all products and services provided in Singapore are subject to The Goods and Services Tax at a rate of seven percent.</p>
												<p>An organization must be registered as The Goods and Services Tax payer if its annual income has exceeded or is expected to exceed 1 million Singapore dollars.</p>

This is a country of the resorts and casinos, that helps to increace a large concentration of investments.</p>

											<p class="sub-list"><strong> The Principality is an attractive offshore destination in terms of jurisdiction and taxation. However, it cannot be called a typical offshore zone. It is necessary to appeal to the government and get a permission. Otherwise, the company registration is impossible. </strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Company registration approval can be obtained through the Direction de l’Expansion Economique. The minimum capital for an establishment is 150,000 euros. However, there is no real estate or inheritance taxex and income tax.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Another important feature is the level of confidentiality, that is considered as the most unique in the European space.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>The legislation for the companies includes a set of Acts of the Monagesque Commercial Code, that consist of:</strong></p>
											<ul class="modal-list">
												<li>The Trust Indenture Act №214 of February 27, 1936;</li>
												<li>The Basic Law №56 of January 29, 1922;</li>
												<li>The French Banking Act 1984 of January 24, 1984.</li>
											</ul>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>According to the Monaco jurisdiction, the foreign businessmen can set up their business here. However, there is a requirement of the company office opening. That is why, you need to rent or purchase premises.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Be aware, the real estate prices are incredibly high here. It is impossible to acquire a shelf company in Monaco. A ready-made company can only be bought from the previous owner, but even in this case, it is necessary to get the consent of the Monaco Government to approve the new owner. </strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>There are several types of companies, possible to register due to the Monaco jurisdiction.</strong></p>
											<ul class="modal-list" style="list-style: none">
												<li>1. A limited liability company, at the head with two executive officers – natural persons only. The directors undertake to serve as the shareholders (one of them must be a resident of Monaco).</li>
												<li>2. A limited liability partnership. The citizens of any country are allowed to become the resident of such partnership.</li>
												<li>3. Unlimited liability Partnership. The terms of establishment are the same.</li>
												<li>4. A joint-stock company. It should comprise the shareholders with two types of responsibility.</li>
												<li>5. A private entrepreneur. A native of Monaco must be a resident.</li>
												<li>6. A branch of a foreign company/corporation at the head with the resident director only.</li>
												<li>7.  Trust company. The residence of the founders within the jurisdiction of one year is essential.</li>
												<li>8. Representative office of a foreign company. A resident manager is required.</li>
												<li>9.  Trust. This type is not a legal entity. Only a resident is allowed to act as a founder. The only option where confidentiality is almost brought to naught.</li>
											</ul>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>The registration process takes about three weeks. There are no strict requirements for naming, and they are minimized.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Regardless of the chosen language, the name should be written in Latin alphabet. However, its uniqueness is necessary. For certain types of activities, a special permission must be obtained to write it to the name.</strong></p>

												<p>An important issue in the process of a companies establishment is income tax and other types of it. In this case, the Principality of Monaco provides a commercial activities tax, which is 33.5%. At the same time, the condition is met – deals outside the jurisdiction must come to at least 25% of the total corporation turnover.</p>
												<p>Companies that receive 75% of the profits from financial transactions within the territory of Monaco are completely exempt from taxation.</p>
												<p>As for a tax of 33.5%, there is one possibility that allows reducing the percentage to 10. Businessmen who maintain a small business in the jurisdiction, but receive large income outside it, can register most of it as wages. </p>
												<p>Therefore, they exempt themselves from income taxes. However, this gap has already been noticed, and it is only a matter of time before it will be taken down.</p>
												<p>Trusts are the most attractive form of doing business in Monaco. Their advantageous taxation system makes its establishment very profitable. In the trust creation process, you must pay a percentage of the total managed property value.</p>
												<p>The number of beneficial owners directly influences the tax rate; it can be 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.7%. Also, the tax is reduced in the case of the trust managing that is located within Monaco. Futher, the annual tax will be 0.2% of the property value. </p>

												<p>Organizations, enterprises and registered foundations that do not carry out their commercial activities and their task, according to the charter, does not provide the implementation of such activities (therefore, only investment and asset management or the inclusion of participation shares, or other rights that, in fact, do not imply commercial activities) provide reports on the assets and liabilities every year.</p>
												<p>For this reason, the Liechtenstein administrative authority must provide the official confirmation to the Department of the State Registration, that a report of the assets and liabilities is available and there was no commercial activity in the previous year (no statement of assets and liabilities should be submitted).</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent2413">
												<p>It takes no more than a week to register a company in Liechtenstein.</p>

												<p>A legal entity, entered in the state register for dissolution, as well as the Trust Company, cannot be liquidated until six months after the convening of the third line of creditors. Deposit funds and trust companies can be legally expelled from the register within a few days. The main reason for deregistration, in all cases, is the decision of dissolution.</p>

												<p>In the case of companies incorporated as limited liability companies / holding companies, income or asset gains are not subject to a capital gains tax or income tax in Liechtenstein.</p>
												<p>A) The stamp duty or an organization fee must be paid after registration of a company in Liechtenstein.<br/>During the establishing of a limited liability company, joint stock company, cooperative, the stamp duty is one percent if the capital amount exceeds CHF 1.000.000. The same fee should be paid for capital increases too.</p>
												<p>A registration fee or a deposit fee is required to be paid after registration. The fee depends on the capital and legal form and should be paid after entering the state register, or submitting the incorporation documentation for preservation, as required by law. In the case of a limited liability company, fees must be added for the preparation of the statutory state documentation regarding the founding procedure, as well as the costs of the statutory announcements in the official press.</p>
												<p>B) The following taxes should be paid after registration of a company in Liechtenstein, according to the relevant system:<br/>A Corporate tax — A Capital gains tax. All legal entities, as well as trust companies and trust communities, must pay capital tax — one-tenth of a net assets percent, but not less than CHF 1000.00 – per year.<br/>A Tax deduction at source — 4 per cent. <br/>Taxation on securities.<br/>In general, it is 0.15% for securities of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and 0.3% for securities of other countries. Liechtenstein banking institutions and brokers are generally responsible for payments, as well as others if they are involved in saling and purchasing of securities.<br/>Value added taxation (VAT)<br/>On January 1, 1995, the turnover tax (called WUST) was replaced by value added tax (VAT). Liechtenstein holding companies and local businesses are exempt from VAT if they have no turnover by the country.</p>

												<p>Regarding the latest changes in the International and, especially, European legislation, the status of a company resident and the ownership of a VAT number are becoming the most important aspects of the trading companies work.

												<p>It is possible to obtain a VAT number without losing the tax benefits in Latvia. The country is not at any black lists, moreover its legislation allows reducing the corporate tax rate. These circumstances make Latvian partnerships attractive for the foreign trade.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent254">
												<p>The biggest advantage of Latvia over the traditional “holding” jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, Austria and Cyprus is its flexibility. There are no additional requirements of receiving the tax benefits in Latvia, such as the mandatory percentage participation, the duration of shareholding, nature of business, taxation level in the country of the subsidiary, etc.</p>
												<p>The EU Parent Subsidiary Directive allows the repatriation tax implementation at 0% tax rate for companies, registered in the European Union. Withholding tax is reduced on the basis of double taxation treaties signed by more than 50 countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.</p>

												<p>Swiss law provides only two legal forms of organizations that can be registered on its territory.</p>
												<ul class="tab-list">
													<li>A Limited Liability Company. At least one of the directors must be a Swiss citizen. Whilst the documents are filled for the state company registration, the founders must pay no less than 20,000 Swiss francs. Each year, a legal entity must submit the reports in the appropriate forms, provided by the legislation of a particular canton.</li>
													<li>A Joint-stock company. The directors of the company are appointed by the founders, there are no specific requirements for their citizenship, but one of them must be a Swiss citizen. The amount of the joint stock company authorized capital is from 100,000 Swiss francs. Every year you need to submit an information about the accounting transactions, turnover of goods and income. In some cases, such a company is required to be audited annualy.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Business owners of another country can open a branch in Switzerland. At the same time, the parent company is still the founder; there are no specific requirements for the amount of the authorized capital. The only one requirement is that one employee of the management team should live in Switzerland.</p>
												<p>There is no need to collect a huge package of documents for the branch registration. Moreover, a preferential tax rate applies to the branches income received in the state.</p>

												<p>Austria is welcoming the foreign investors by a thriving sophisticated business center and a traditional trading bridge located in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.</p>
												<p>The tax policy of Austria does not provide the control for the offshore countries, it has several tax agreements, for example, with Belize, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates (Dubai).</p>
												<p>Complex tax minimization structures are intended for all types of business — trade, holding structures, investment or royalty companies. With efficient tax planning and restructuring, the effective tax rate can be below 3-5%.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent292">
												<p>There are unlimited possibilities for using the existing Austrian organization due to the tax planning. A company, incorporated in Austria can be exempted from dividends and foreign capital gains taxes, even if the foreign legal entity is located in an offshore jurisdiction.</p>
												<p>Austria does not accept C.F.C. legislation, nor any thin capitalization rules or debt-to-equity ratio. Therefore, you can get benefit from the Austrian company by purchasing funds for investment.</p>
												<p>Any interest, received from this loan, is completely tax exempt. There is no withholding tax on payments to the foreign creditors, even if the interest is paid to an offshore company or jurisdictions without a double taxation treaty.</p>
												<p>The company in Austria is ideal option for a royalty company — for the purpose of obtaining royalties on patents or other intellectual property from subsidiaries and third parties. More than 60 Avoidance of double taxation agreements have been signed, and many countries have reduced the tax rates or have 0% rate on incoming and outgoing royalties.</p>
												<p>Since Austria is a member of the EU, the Savings and Royalties EU Directive can be applied. It provides that, as long the parent company owns at least 10% of the subsidiary shares within the European Union for at least one year, there are no withholding tax levied on the payment of royalties to the Austrian company.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="tab-pane fade" id="modcontent293">
												<p>CORPORATE INCOME TAX (CIT): The standard rate is 25%. With the efficient tax planning and restructuring, the effective tax rate can be lower than 3-5%.</p>
												<p>INCOMING DIVIDENDS: 0% overall for EU and countries with the tax treaties.</p>
												<p>Capital Gains Tax (CGT): Companies are generally taxed at the standard corporate tax rate, although the reductions and exemptions are widely applied, as the result, an effective rate is 0%.</p>
												<p>REPATRIATION TAX:</p>
												<p>Royalty: 0% or reduced according to the tax treaty or the EU Directive. Otherwise, the tax rate is 20%.</p>
												<p>DIVIDENDS: 0% or reduced for the dividends paid by an EU entity or treaty of jurisdiction. Otherwise, the tax rate is 25%.</p>
												<p>INTEREST: As a general rule, no withholding tax is charged on interest.</p>
												<p>VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT). EU VAT regime. The standard rate for the internal sales is 20%.</p>

											<p><strong>Registration of a company in Andorra</strong></p>
											<p>The specific feature of the Andorra legislation is the lack of possibility to buy a turnkey offshore company. It is not profitable and almost impossible. According to the laws of Andorra, the Articles of Association must describe the planned activities in the minute detail.</p>
											<p>All future operations are accurately spelled out and submitted to the authorities.</p>
											<p>This fact greatly distinguishes the country from other jurisdictions. In Andorra, it is impossible to start selling cars, and then hold a board of directors and switch to producing the computers under the same name of company. However, this country is great for a company registration.</p>
											<p>Despite the strict legislation for anti money-laundering, Andorra provides a good climate for doing business. Low taxes also have a positive effect on the company development. It is also important that the taxes in Andorra are fixed, easily calculated and predicted. It makes work and financial reporting much easier.</p>
											<p>The registration procedure is transparent, but requires learning the system. However, the Andorran laws impose a number of small requirements to the company. They are simple, but need some effort to fulfill them.</p>
											<p>Therefore, the best way to open a company in Andorra is to ask the specialists who will perform all the preparatory operations and simplify the registration procedure for the owner as much as possible.</p>

											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Registration of a new company is carried through the Ministry of Commerce. The state politics of Andorra does not want to support the low-budget offshore companies appearing on its territory.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>The government does not intend to compete with the Seychelles or Belize in this controversial area in terms of the International law. The company you register with the Acalista group will be completely onshore but low taxed.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>The Articles of Association can be changed or expanded, depending on the circumstances your business will meet. You can always add a new type of trading activity to your company list. But if a new company has a large number of activities in the charter, then the procedure for its approval can be visibly delayed.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Therefore, it's better to set the right balance. It is recommended to make the Articles of Association as broad as possible without the risk of delaying the approval procedure. A good decision is to buy a ready-made company with a local registration.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>Acalista group has a list of options available for purchase. The prices of the companies are quite loyal and acceptable. If none of the proposed options meets the personal requirements, it is possible to choose the most suitable one and apply for a change in the Articles of Association.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>It is essential to certify the registration with a notary just after the Andorran authorities approve it. The notary will provide the Deed of Incorporation. This document will contain the names of all shareholders and information about the number of shares. All shares transactions must be certified by a local notary.</strong></p>
											<p class="sub-list"><strong>It will be much easier to entrust the The Articles of Association writing to a lawyer, specializing on the company registration in Andorra. The specialist's fee is usually set privately and depends on the business specifics.</strong></p>

												<p>A company registered in Andorra can conduct commercial activities all around the world. The organization has become a resident of the country. </p>
												<p>Andorra does not have a Central State Corporate Register. Therefore, verification of the company name uniqueness will take at least five days.

											<p><strong>Registration of a company in Brunei</strong></p>
											<p>Brunei (Brunei Darussalam) – a small state (a sultanate) in Southeast Asia with huge potential for opening and conducting a business. It is one of the richest countries in the world. The main economic spheres here are the oil and timber industries, as well as agriculture.</p>
											<p>But the most areas of investment are telecommunications and e-commerce. Moreover, the government, represented by the Sultan, supports foreign investment, promotes its attraction and expansion.</p>
											<p>Brunei becomes the center of an offshore business because of the sultanate's economy structure. However, the registration of a company has its percularities, that are familiar to the Acalista group specialists.</p>

												<p>Brunei is an ideal place for business establishment and development: the state offers comfortable conditions for both local businessmen and non-resident investors. Moreover, the country's currency is reliable and stable.</p>
												<p>There are four forms of business organizations in Brunei Darussalam, as well as in other countries. But there are some restrictions for the foreign investors. Therefore, a businessman from another country cannot conduct a private business in Brunei.</p>
												<p>Other forms (partnership, open-type and closed-type joint stock companies, a branch of a foreign company) do not have such prohibitions. For the partnership establishment, non-residents of the Sultanate must obtain a special permition from the Department of Immigration, Economic Planning and Development, as well as from the Ministry of Labor. </p>
												<p>All companies are required to submit financial statements regularly, but an audit is not necessary. At the same time, there is no currency control. The taxation system is well-to-do for the foreign investors. They should not pay: </p>
												<ul class="tab-list">
													<li>a duty;</li>
													<li>an income tax;</li>
													<li>a corporate tax;</li>
													<li>a stamp duty tax;</li>
													<li>a capital gains tax.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>However, a corporate income tax reaches 30%. But the resident companies pay tax on a whole income (received within and outside the country), and the foreign organizations – only on the profits earned within the jurisdiction.</p>
												<p>The main terms of the international business registration in Brunei: a local registered office and resident agent, closed access to reporting (confidentiality of data), information about the form of organization in the name, prohibition on the share capital payment in local currency (Brunei dollar), a local cityzen secretary.</p>
												<p>However, the director does not have to be a resident of the sultanate. Meetings can be held in any country. Another condition – the name of the organization should not contain the Cyrillic. Remarkably, the Brunei Darussalam authorities have signed an agreement with 12 countries to avoid double taxation.</p>

												<p>Since 2008, the state has been an external creditor with investment status without any debts, according to the statement of two rating agencies. Sure, there were economic downturns in the period from 2008 to 2010, but Brazil coped with all the difficulties and came back to the ranking of the most prosperous countries.</p>
												<p>The state is one of the most profitable for the foreign investments due to the high interest rates and steady economic growth.</p>
												<p>The Brazilian capital increasing caused the rapid growth of the local currency, that forced the heads of government to raise taxes on some foreign investment. Because of the rational approach to financial management, Brazil has become a steady country in the global economy.</p>
												<p>Brazil is one of the most substantial countries in the developing world and has the largest economic potential among the Latin American countries.</p>

Since 2012, the IRS in the United States has carried out a tight control for the offshore banks, closing small ones and imposing huge fines on large ones that could pay. The fines are still imposed on those who do not file the reports for the dollar accounts.</p>
											<p class="bottom">As we know, the US Congress enact the Foreign Account and Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). It requires all international banks that deal with the US dollar to report the US dollar accounts holders each year. In practice, this fact has turned the offshore bankers into unpaid IRS agents.</p>
											<div class="hidden-text">
												<p class="bottom">The project was delayed for years, and no one understood how it would be implemented. This uncertainty made it almost impossible to obtain the new offshore bank licenses and did not guarantee the applicant to open a correspondent account.</p>

												<p class="bottom">The IRC proved the importance of the adopted law in 2016 and almost every bank in the world signed an agreement with the FATCA. Currently, new banks are faced with additional requirements, however, in practice, they all are possible to fulfill.</p>

										<li><span>If you are choosing a jurisdiction, you should figure out the reserve share capital amount. </span>Some legislative acts require from $ 500,000 to $ 3 million for a license of a controlled bank and from $ 1 million to $ 7 million of a share capital for a small international bank. Jurisdictions such as Panama and Luxembourg will require $ 30 million for a general license.</li>
										<li><span>Andorra and Luxembourg </span>issue licenses for the large private banks.</li>
										<li><span>The Cayman Islands </span>prefer the investment and controlled banks (the jurisdiction is able to conduct transactions of the highest degree of reliability).</li>
										<li><span>Vanuatu </span>is a common jurisdiction for the European parent companies.</li>

											<p class="top">The presence of a forex broker license for a forex broker is the main criterion in choosing a forex broker for traders. Licenses show which regulator controls the company quality and activities. What information can a trader extract?</p>
											<p class="top">For example, the license of the American futures regulator NFA controls one market, while the license for Antigua or Mauritius controls completely different market. There are a lot of regulators in the world that issue broker licenses for the forex activities with the important differences between them. Therefore, the trader should understand that the licenses issued by different regulatory authorities are not equal. That is why different forex licenses are rated differently in the forex broker rating. The most powerful forex broker licenses are awarded 100 points; licenses of the state bodies regulating the financial market are awarded 50 points; non-state self-proclaimed market regulators that have no influence on the forex brokers get 10 points.</p>
											<p class="top">A forex broker's license is necessary, but not the only argument in choosing a broker and opening an account with his company. For choosing a broker, it is necessary to consider the whole range of criteria for the forex brokers rating. This is what the professional traders do.</p>

											<p class="bottom">This article provides information <strong>about the Electronic Money Institution (EMI) — </strong>an electronic money license for a company, registered in the UK.</p>
											<p class="bottom">Depending on the turnover level, there are 2 options for registering an EMI license in the UK:<br/>— a classic EMI, in this case the fee (duty) to the FCA will be £ 5,000;<br/>— a small EMI (the monthly turnover should not exceed € 3,000,000; if the company do not conduct business — we will estimate according to the projections).
												<p class="title">Timelines of registration</p>
												<p class="bottom">3 months (if the regulator — FCA, do not have any questions about the submitted application);<br/>Up to 12 months (in case the FCA requests the additional documents).</p>
												<p class="bottom">It should be noted that the electronic money application is being implemented in general in the international regulation sphere. The companies with the electronic money can effectively offer a number of banking services and services for the client funds holding, as a rule, these services are provided online (that implies a lot of risks). Therefore, this  well-organized application is just one step below the bank (if we consider this application as a financial instrument).</p>
											</p>
											<div class="hidden-text">
												<p class="bottom">There are less requirements to the fund managers, stock brokers, depositories activities. For this reason, it is neccessary to know the features of the application (electronic money), all the key issues of the professional management and the attendant risks or problems and how to solve them asap.</p>
												<p class="bottom">First of all, conducting an EMI business requires the appropriate education and knowledge to manage and obtain an EMI license. It means that:<br/>— The Senior Management must be experienced in organizing of such a type of company. This is an important fact for the FCA; persons with no experience in the field usually do not obtain a permission.<br/>— The company must be managed from the UK.</p>

									<p class="text-center list-sub-title"></p>
									<ul class="marked-list-2">
										<li>The company must have more UK resident directors (or an equal number) than foreign directors (their nationality does not matter).</li>
										<li>The FCA affirms that the decisions of the Resident Director have a higher force; he may reject policies, strategies and decisions that are transferred from overseas if they do not comply with the UK law or regulation.</li>
										<li>The meetings of the Board of Directors must be held in the UK.</li>
										<li>Operational day-to-day decisions must be made in the UK and the office must be based in the same state.</li>
										<li>A company may have a non-resident director on the Board of Directors of a UK company if the entire organization is completely based in the UK.</li>
										<li>The CEO must be a resident and reside in the UK, and, as practice shows, the Compliance Manager as well.</li>
										<li>The person responsible for a money-laundering control (that can also be a CEO if he has appropriate qualification) must be a resident of the UK.</li>
										<li>If anyone moves to the UK with the intention of being a CEO, he should know the management rules, depending on the business model. Consequently, it may be necessary to appoint a local manager who has the competence to enforce the rules.</li>
										<li>The services provided by any third party — as well as IT support services — must be provided on the basis of a concluded contract.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="text-center list-sub-title">Secondly, there will be a necessity to open bank accounts that will allow your company to provide your services. The bank accounts must be under the name of your UK registered company. The accounts will be required to receive the customer's funds, until they are sent to the final recipient.</p>
									<p class="text-center list-sub-title">The accounts can be opened at any bank. Moreover, it should be a savings account. It is an important requirement of the FCA.</p>
									<div class="modal-section-title text-center">The main features <span>that must be considered for submitting an application:</span></div>
									<p class="text-center list-sub-title"></p>
									<ul class="marked-list-2">

											<p class="bottom">This section provides information on the factors <strong>of an EMI license obtaining in Latvia — a license for electronic money in Latvia. </strong>The license is obtained by filing an application, as well as a number of other documents, to the EFSA — Estonian Financial Supervision Authority<br/>This is the best option in terms of timelines / price / European license status.<br/><strong>Acalista </strong>group can offer such jurisdictions as Malta, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Great Britain, but all of them will be more expensive.</p>
											<p class="title">More details about the EMI license in Latvia</p>
											<p class="bottom">According to the Latvian legislation, if the amount of the issued e-money in the business plan does not exceed 2 million euros per year, the company can start its activities in Latvia after registration (without obtaining a full license).<br/>In this case, information about the company, members of the board, a plan of commercial activities, documents on a money-laundering control and information on measures for the client money safety are submitted to the Financial and Capital Market Commission. There are no capital requirements.<br/>If you are planning a larger turnover, you need to obtain a large (full) license. In this case, the initial capital of the company applying for a license must be at least 350,000 euros. The information and documents specified in the law should be prepared for a licence obtaining  (we can provide more details on your request).</p>

									<ul class="marked-list-2">
										<li>Make a registration of a company in Latvia. <br/>In this case, besides the company registration, it is necessary to submit to the Authority a smaller package of documents that:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>firstly, </strong>will simplify the process of the necessary procedure to start an activity;</li>
												<li><strong>secondly, </strong>will allow to detect and settle all possible claims of the commission regarding the board members and the commercial plan (the basis of which will be later used to obtain a license) at the initial stage;</li>
												<li><strong>thirdly, </strong>will allow you to know better the specifics of the company's work in this jurisdiction</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Please note that registered companies must operate only in the territory of Latvia. However, in the case of providing services on the Internet, it is difficult to identify the service territory. That is, if an agreement is concluded in Riga, Latvia, it can be insisted that the service is provided in Latvia (a lot of companies, registered in Latvia and working with foreign clients do that).</li>
										<li>We recommend to go through the first registration stage, regardless whether you are ready for the whole licensing or not, as it allows the FKTK to get acquainted with your company beforehand and will simplify the further licensing procedure.</li>

											<p class="bottom">В нынешнем году в юридическом области игорной веб-индустрии на европейском континенте протекают серьезные изменения. Одна из основополагающих тенденций на сегодняшний день – это введение, практически, каждым из наиболее значимых государств Европы лицензирования.</p>
											<p class="bottom">Большой спрос к этой сфере услуг дала постоянно увеличивающаяся популярность веббукмекеров и казино, которые основываются в Европейских и оффшорных юрисдикциях, в том числе в юрисдикциях Гибралтара, Мальты, Кюрасао, Коста-Рики.</p>
										</div>

							<section class="modal-section game4">
								<div class="container">
									<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Рейтинг </span>Букмекеров</div>
									<p class="dark">«Пальма первенства» в ограничении персональных торговых площадок, безусловно, принадлежит крупнейшим странам Европы, а именно Испании, Италии, Франции, Великобритании.</p>
									<p class="dark">Эти страны, начиная с 2000-х годов, стали организовывать финансовые учреждения, которые регулируют игорную активность в сети и блокируют вход на торговые площадки для оффшоровых операторов.</p>
									<p class="dark">Благодаря нишевой позиции игровой веб-индустрии, Европа перестала пытаться ее контролировать на национальном уровне. Вот почему в разработке персональной законодательной базы теперь имеются еще и аутсайдеры. Например, нидерландское государство только в июле 2016 года смогло сформировать нужный законопроект.</p>
									<p class="dark">И он вряд ли будет в силе с 2018 года. Кипр – это еще одна страна, которая поздно присоединилась к данной тенденции. Это островная красивая страна, которая приняла закон про регулирование игровой деятельности почти десять лет назад – в 2012 году.</p>
									<p class="dark">Но полноценно регулировать деятельность букмекерских компаний в сети Кипр, в силу многочисленных факторов, стал пробовать только с 2016 года.</p>
									<p class="dark">Для этих задач была специально создана такая организация, как Нацкомиссия по играм (National Betting Authority). Последняя сказала, что принимает решения выдавать лицензии веб-букмекерам, начиная с третьего октября 2016 года.</p>
									<p class="dark">Многие туристы из стран Содружества независимых государств, которые приезжали отдохнуть на Кипр, не понаслышке знают, что среди киприотов крайне популярны всевозможные игры.</p>
									<p class="dark">Почти на каждой магистральной улочке крупного городка здесь будет хотя бы парочка игорных организаций – помещения для игры в кено или бинго, пункты приема ставок букмекерских контор.</p>
									<p class="dark">Еще совсем недавно на Юге Кипра, где власти более ответственно и серьезно контролируют игорный бизнес, действовал законопроект, который запрещал играть в казино.</p>
									<p class="dark">Поклонникам таких развлечений приходилось переходить разделительную полосу и ехать в северную часть страны, чтобы попасть в один из центров казино (здесь игорный бизнес под контролем администрации Турции). Но этот запрет не так давно был снят – чтобы привлечь вкладчиков для построения интегрированного курорта по казино.</p>
									<p class="dark"><strong>Кипра интересуют финансово стабильные претенденты на лицензирование </strong></p>
									<p class="dark">Ясное дело, что крайне высокая популярность игорного бизнеса – это один из основополагающих моментов, из-за которых законодатели поставили крайне высокую планку вхождения на торговые площадки.</p>
									<p class="dark">Поскольку обязанность и условие сформировать уставной капитал в размере пятисот тысяч евро, с подкреплением гарантией от банковских учреждений тоже на пятьсот тысяч евро, это совсем немало не только по объемам государства с населением меньше одного миллиона человек. </p>
									<p class="dark">Это в пять-семь раз больше, чем на Мальте и в Великобритании – в лидирующих юрисдикциях.</p>
									<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Лицензированные </span>платежные обязательства</div>
									<p class="dark">Лицензированные платежные обязательства в тридцать тысяч евро за год за годовое лицензирование и сорок пять тысяч евро за двухгодовое лицензирование – не будет считаться низким. Прибавьте к этому еще и игорное налогообложение в тринадцать процентов от валовой игорной доходности.</p>
									<p class="dark">Десять процентов от налоговой ставки, непосредственно, будет отправлено в казну. Остаток в три процента будет разделен между фондами, которые поддерживают спортфедерации и фонды, которые предотвращают и лечат игорную зависимость. </p>
									<p class="dark">Регулятор, который поставил такие немалые условия, дает очень точный сигнал того, что Кипр интересуется исключительно финансово стабильными претендентами на лицензирование.</p>
									<p class="dark">В число подобных претендентов, логично, что попадают и большие региональные операторы наземного букмекерства. Кроме того, выше обозначенные условия не составляют проблемы для глобальных лидерующих представителей в интернет-области.</p>
									<p class="dark">Так получится ли у Кипра привлекать лидирующих операторов и лицензирование в государства, повторив прошлый удачный опыт в региональном объеме Мальты, другого средиземноморского активно развивающегося островновго государства?</p>
									<p class="dark">Наша компания придерживается осторожного мнения на этот счет и имеет в этом плане оптимистические позиции.</p>
									<p class="dark">С одной стороны, кроме большой цены, лицензирование еще ограничивается по линейке продукции. Создатели законодательных актов предпочитают «убрать» не только игровую линейку казино, но еще и такие типы спотставок, как спортставки на собачьи и лошадиные забеги, спрэд-бэттинг.</p>
									<p class="dark">Кроме того, регуляторы выдвигают требование применять веб-ресурс конкретно с доменом — .com.cy</p>
									<p class="dark">Но, кроме таких существенных недочетов, в противовес, можно назвать и суперважные благоприятствующие элементы. Согласно приходящего информационного потока, комиссия обладает широкими источниками для стремительного рассматрения четко выполненных заявок от профессиональных фирм.</p>
									<p class="dark">Наиболее положительное оценивание – от пары недель до выдачи предварительного одобрения, что намного быстрее других юридических фирм.</p>
									<p class="dark">Кроме того, НКБ не выдвигает требования о создании полноценной инфраструктуры серверов операторов на кипрском полуострове. На самом деле, хватит всего лишь и одного сервера, чтобы контролировать регуляторскую деятельность.</p>
									<p class="dark">Но, возможно, самое основное достоинство, в этом случае, – это лингвистическая и геополитическая характеристика и особенность Кипра. В Республике Кипр законодательством признается три языка – греческий, турецкий и английский.</p>
									<p class="dark">То есть, местное островное лицензирование – это, возможно, наиболее мудрое решение при избрании операторов, которые ориентируются на рынке близлежащих государств с соответствующими языками. С точки зрения репутации, кипрский остров обладает узнаваемыми характеристиками для аудиторий части восточной стороны Средиземного моря.</p>
									<p class="dark">Кроме того, появление в странах Европы официально прошедших лицензии турецкоязычных веб-сайтов – это, возможно, еще один привлекательный момент для поклонников азартных игр из масштабной диаспоры Турции в странах западной Европы.</p>
									<p class="dark">Безусловно, Кипр и не сможет обеспечивать сотнями лицензирование, как сейчас это делает Мальта.</p>
									<p class="dark">Но, вероятно, изначально таких планов и не было. Наверное, основная задача запуска – это привлекать несколько сотен стабильных и профессиональных операторов для финансово счастливого запуска в регионе и в самом государстве.</p>

										<h2>History of a gambling business <span>legalization in Denmark</span></h2>
									</div>
									<p class="dark">The history of illegal gambling in Denmark is quite long. In the post-war period, it was easier to monopolize all possible types of gambling than to fight them. In 1948, the Danske Spil company was created for this. This brand has existed to that end.</p>
									<p class="dark">Though, the slot machines was allowed in the entertainment places, the game was provided only for the conditional monetary units.</p>
									<p class="dark">Later, at the turn of the 70s and 80s of the twentieth century, there was a large number of clandestine gambling organizations, that were available only for trusted people. Such places were usually located in bars.</p>
									<p class="dark">An interesting fact is that in the clandestine gambling places the game was for matches or pieces of paper, that were later exchanged for cash, according to the specially established pay tables.</p>
									<p class="dark">After the legislation had taken another step towards  liberalizing gambling in 1990, the demand for clandestine organizations was redused.</p>
									<p class="dark">The amendments to the current legislation provided opportunities for the admission of the casino operators from a number of European countries (Germany, Austria, the Netherlands). However, the activities in Denmark need obtaining a license and compliance with the extremely strict requirements.</p>
									<p class="dark">One of the regulations that the requirements included, was the creation a joint venture with a resident from Denmark by a foreign agent. Due to this fact, the gambling organizations have started to placed in the hotels, that operate as partners.</p>
									<p class="dark">With the Internet development, a large number of online casinos have appeared with the full tools in the form of games and bets. As this business sector began to grow rapidly, the government faced the need for legislative regulation of it.</p>
									<p class="dark">One of the first steps was the ban on the foreign companies activities in territories controlled by the Danish jurisdiction in 2003. Online casino operators were quite often registered in countries with a freer market in terms of government control.</p>
									<p class="dark">Therefore, the Danish banks were forced to refuse servicing the credit cards, that were used to pay for services in the online gambling organizations.</p>
									<p class="dark">When such initiatives were appeared in Danish legislation, it has caused a negative reaction from the European Union. The disagreement between local requirements and European institutions has been worsened since Denmark ratified the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in 2008.</p>
									<p class="dark">For the status quo resumption, there were made changes in the existing legislation on the gambling business in 2010. The applying started in 2012.</p>
									<p class="dark">One of the initiatives was the Danske Spil's legal deprivation of gambling monopolization and de facto the access of the foreign agents to the local market. The state retained the right for the state lottery, bingo game, lottery scratch cards, bets on horse, dog and pigeon races.</p>
									<p class="dark">The private companies have got the right to engage in such gambling activities as slots, betting and online casinos.</p>
									<p class="dark">However, in 2014, a number of amendments were adopted. It has significantly tightened the legislation against the foreign operators. First of all, both operators and distributors of casino software, according to the new amendments, were obliged to be tested and licensed in Denmark.</p>
									<p class="dark">The online casinos owners from abroad were obliged to pay tax in the amount of 20% of income to the Danish budget.</p>

									<p class="dark">Among other types of gaming activities is a poker. According to the Danish legislation,  the sports poker cannot be classified as gambling, and thereby, the organization does not need a license.</p>
									<p class="dark">The poker, especially an online game, has been popular in Denmark for quite a long time. This popularity is caused by the success of Copenhagen resident Gustav Hansen, a professional poker player. The amount of a prize money he had gotten for over 10 years of playing was almost $ 10 million.</p>
									<p class="dark">The popularity of poker in Denmark is also a reason why this small country is consistently ranked 25th in the global WSOP rankings. Unfortunately, the information on an annual income for a poker organization is unclear.</p>

									<p class="dark">A commercial gaming activities will not be legal without obtaining an official permit from the appropriate authority. The Ministry of Justice provides the licensing of gambling organizarions.</p>
									<p class="dark">The concept of gambling debt is equated to a “duty of honor” in public etiquette, because the legal payment of gambling debts is not provided for the unlicensed games.</p>
									<p class="dark">According to the legislative regulations, a specialized Office of  Gambling Control has been providing licenses for individuals and legal entities who want to conduct commercial gambling activities since 2012. The licensing terms are following:</p>
									<ul class="marked-list top">
										<li>providing a detailed justification for conducting the commercial activities in this area from the benefit aspect;</li>
										<li>the applicant has no criminal record and has reached the age of 21;</li>
										<li>confirmation of the clear business reputation of the company;</li>
										<li>payment of the duty, that is $ 37,000 for online casinos and bookmakers, and the duty for both types of commercial organizations will be $ 52,000, it can be paid in local currency;</li>
										<li>the duty for the license itself can vary from $ 7,400 to $ 220,000.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="dark">Criminal liability for the gaming activities organizing in a public place can be in the form of a fine or one year in prison.</p>
									<p class="dark">Criminal liability for providing premises for the unlicensed gambling is in a form of a fine or imprisonment for up to six months, and direct participation in gambling is punished by fines.</p>

											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Organization of lotteries</span></div>
											<p class="dark">Initially, the Danske Spil organization, when it was founded in 1948, was called Dansk Tipstjeneste. The organization was founded by the Danish government, the Olympic Committee and the Sports Federation. About 80% of the sponsorship amount was provided by the government.</p>
											<p class="dark">Two companies were created in 2012, based on this organization. The first one, The Danske Lotteri Spil, covers the lottery segment (Lotto, Keno, Eurojackpot), Bingo lotto, accepts bets on Dantoto equestrian sports and organizes Quick scratch cards. The second, the Danske Licens Spil, is engaged in the activities of bookmakers and online gambling.</p>
											<p class="dark">There is also another state lottery called Klasseloteriet. Before the active development of the Internet, tickets were distributed through a certified dealer network. The slogan, that has been constant for many years, says “Denmark's Millions Lottery”..</p>
											<p class="dark">It performs two functions at once – to emphasize the amount of the potential winnings and the extencive participation in the lottery. Each ticket contains a unique numerical combination, and the price of each lottery ticket directly depends on the potential winnings.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Online casinos</span></div>
											<p class="dark">Before the Danish online casino legislation was amended in 2010, there had been about 400 online casinos in the Kingdom, most of which were created in collaboration with the Danish residents.</p>
											<p class="dark">Due to the fact that the new legislation provided the licensing, a large number of operators decided to legalize their commercial activities. During the first year of the new legislation, only 25 licenses were issued by the Danish Gambling Authority.</p>
											<p class="dark">The companies such as the 888, the Ladbrokes and the Bwin were among the first to legalize their sites. At the same time, about 57 sites were blacklisted as unlicensed.</p>
											<p class="dark">There are currently about 210 online casinos in Denmark. Most of them have two languages in the interface – Danish and English, and currencies they use are dollars, euros and Danish kroner. Such sites as  Dansk777 Casino, Casino Cruise and Bet365 use the toolkit that matches the casino exactly.</p>
											<p class="dark">Sites like All Slots Mobile, 32Red Mobile, and Golden Riviera specialize in mobile gambling content. Services such as Zezam, Spillenjørnet, Live Casino and Casino are officially supported by the Danske Licens Spil.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Betting</span></div>
											<p class="dark">The bets are mostly accepted on various sports events in the gambling industry. The most popular events are soccer competitions that are broadcasted on the Danish television, i.e. the English Premier League and the National Football League.</p>
											<p class="dark">Because of the golf success of Thomas Bjorn, a resident of Silkeborg, the sport calls attention by the Danes too and the bets are accepted on it. Also, such sports as handball and badminton are popular with bookmakers. Recently, there has also been an increase in the number of bets on cycling.</p>
											<p class="dark">In many ways, such a high popularity of this sports competition is caused by Denmark's proposal to host the first stage of the Tour de France on its territory.</p>
											<p class="dark">A smaller, but no less significant, segment in the betting industry is the financial and political events – an integral part of the betting industry.</p>
											<p class="dark">The TopBetta, the Fanaments and the Star Fantasy League Operators have a clear focus on the fantasy sports betting, but other operators, such as the Bet365, also have these items in the sportsbook list.</p>
											<p class="dark">Notably, that the Bet365 and the BetEnt are affiliated representations of world-class bookmakers, but the Danske Licens Spil is the leader among operators.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Land-based casino organization</span></div>
											<p class="dark">This type of casino effected to the weakening of the Danske Spil state monopoly. Nowadays, the stationary casinos are operating in Copenhagen, Aalborg, Helsingor, Aarhus, Vejle and Odense.</p>
											<p class="dark">Moreover, there is the Pearl Seaways ferry that runs between Oslo and Copenhagen, that is also provided by a gambling organization. The Copenhagen casino are the first among the largest gambling organizations in Northern Europe. The types of gambling in land-based casinos are represented by slots, poker, blackjack, roulette, baccarat and punto banco.</p>
											<p class="dark">The regulation of this type of casino is carried out as follows:</p>
											<ul class="marked-list top">
												<li>the minimum entrance fee should be about $ 14;</li>
												<li>the casino should work no more than 14 hours a day;</li>
												<li>the clients must have the membership cards;</li>
												<li>the minors cannot join games;</li>
												<li>the clients identification.</li>
											</ul>
											<p class="dark">There is also a list of rules, controlled by the police, about using the recording techniques and the clients' appearance.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Horseback Riding</span></div>
											<p class="dark">The horse racing is a well-developed sport in Denmark. There are 9 racetracks, the largest ones are located in Klumpenborg, Bornholm and Billund. The bets are accepted both beforehand or in-play. The official operator of the equestrian sports betting is the state-owned company – the Danske Lotteti Spil.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-lg-6">
											<div class="modal-section-title text-center"><span>Slot machine industry</span></div>
											<p class="dark">If we look at the data for Denmark in 2012 (that is, even before the amendments to the legislation were adapted) – they are as follows:</p>
											<ul class="marked-list top">
												<li>classic slot machines – 26 thousand;</li>
												<li>arcade slot machines – 3.3 thousand.</li>
											</ul>
											<p class="dark">An average annual income from using the slot machines was about $ 266 million in 2012. This index looks quite impressive, compared with an annual income from online games and betting in general. The last one was $ 296 million in the same year.</p>

									<p class="dark">Despite the fact that the state monopoly on gambling was officially annuled in 2010, many of the control mechanisms and regulatory functions are still running within the state jurisdiction:</p>
									<ul class="marked-list top">
										<li>A licenses obtaining for gambling business. Both private and public companies are required to get a license. Moreover, even the main state operator – the Danske Spil is required to be licensed annually, while the list of games for applicants is strictly regulated.</li>
										<li>Regulation of the advertising campaigns. The operator is allowed to advertise its products only after obtaining a license, and should not use the services of third parties. It is forbidden to involve celebrities in the advertising campaigns. They must also provide information in such a way that a potential consumer can adequately assess their chances of winning.</li>
										<li>Control over the financial activities. During the licensing process, a primary control is carried out, however, additional checks can be conducted at any time. The taxes on gambling business are quite high in Denmark. There are two types of taxes – an income tax for operators (45% for the first 4 million Danish kroner, then 75% is paid, for online establishments – 20%) and a corporate tax, that is 25% of the rest.</li>
										<li>Distribution of funds received as a result of state licensing and taxation. Funds are often refferred to sports and cultural programs.</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="dark">If we take into account the breacking of the state monopoly on all types of gambling business, a detailed study of statistics shows that organizations, controlled by state bodies, still have been having a greater sphere of influence on the gambling services market in comparison with the private companies.</p>
									<p class="dark">The segment of the market, directly or indirectly controlled by the state, is 62%.</p>

									<p class="dark">In order to improve the efficiency of the fight against gambling addiction, the Danish Gambling Authority has created the ROFUS – a special register of self-excluded players. This register aims to protect Danish citizens from gambling, while registration is carried out on a voluntary basis.</p>
									<p class="dark">Once a citizen is registered, he cannot join in both betting and online games that have been licensed. There are two forms – permanent exemption and temporary.</p>
									<p class="dark">A temporary exclusion gives a participant the opportunity to  choose by himself the period during which he will not be able to play. After this period the opportunity will be renewed automatically.</p>
									<p class="dark">The permanent exclusion has a minimum period of one year. When this period is over, an application for deletion from the register may be submitted to the appropriate authority.</p>

									<p class="dark">After the liberalization of legislation in 2010, the gaming services market shows rather slow, but stable increase. If the legislation is not changed in the future, such trends will continue.</p>
									<p class="dark">However, the latest amendments to the legislation in 2014 caused outrage of the state's European partners, so the chance of the new amendments to the legislation is still possible, and all owners of gambling organizations know it.</p>

									<div class="modal-section-title">There are five main points <span>that show all the advantages of running a crypto business in Estonia:</span></div>
									<ul class="marked-list-2">
										<li>A price. In terms of the cost of company registrations, Estonia is very profitable. Here, registration is much cheaper than in Britain, the United States, Switzerland or Singapore. So, a license for opening a virtual currency exchange office in the country is much more affordable than in the mentioned.</li>
										<li>Timelines. It takes a minimum time from the submission of documents for registration to obtaining a license. If everything is prepared correctly, the duration of the procedure will be not more than one and a half months.</li>
										<li>The Laws. Licenses for exchange operations can be obtained quite legally. Since December last year, the using of cryptocurrencies for business has been available to everyone. This is called a "virtual value". In addition, there are conditions in which a token will be qualified as securities. There is the less probability that the regulator will consider the token as a security in Estonia, than in Singapore or the United States. That is why Estonia is so popular for opening an ICO.</li>
										<li>A regulator. Cooperation with regulators, as well as access to them, can be an important factor in any blockchain project. Therefore, coollaboration with the Financial Supervision Authority and other financial regulators in Estonia is much easier than in the States and Singapore.<br/>Representatives of these organizations always provide legal information for the entrepreneurs who deal with electronic currency. A number of problems can be resolved only with their help, therefore feel free to contact them. Most of the staff speak English, as well as Russian, so there is no language barrier.</li>
										<li>A residence in Estonia. The state has been good to the business ideas from all over the world. Nowadays, Estonia is one of the leaders in digitalization and Internet technologies. Any businessman, desiring to start a business in Estonia, can apply for an e-residency card.<br/>It allows you to get access to all government services and simplify relations with the government authorities. The card will help to avoid the bureaucratic problems and save time.</li>
										<li>The taxes. The tax policy here is also one of the most beneficial in the world. Such information is provided by the OECD. There are no income taxes here. The Altcoin, Bitcoin, and many other cryptocurrencies will not be subject to VAT.<br/>Also, all the ICO projects are exempt from tax payments. It means that the income, raised from the ICO, will not be subject to tax payments until the dividends would be distributed.</li>

This is due to the fact that the Singaporean legislation is one of the most loyal to the virtual currencies business.</p>
											<p class="title">Legal position of the authorities</p>
											<p class="top">Over the recent years, the cryptocurrency exchanges development in Singapore has intensified. Therefore, the Singapore Monetary and Financial Authority (MAS) was forced to express its position on this matter many times, as well as to explain some legal rules.</p>
											<p class="top">The MAS was loyal to the companies that deal just with the exchange of virtual currencies, since their activities can be carried out without a government licensing in Singapore.</p>
											<p class="top">At the same time, the companies that have conducted the ICOs and are involved in transactions with securities (most often with the digital tokens) are required to obtain an appropriate Singapore license, since the sphere of securities circulation is clearly regulated in Singapore by a special regulation.</p>
											<p class="top">So, as long as the activities of the intermediary company in Singapore do not treat with the securities market, but just exchange the virtual currencies, no licenses are required. Such attitude of financial management attracts cryptocurrency entrepreneurs from various countries.</p>

											<p class="top">Since the Money Laundering Control Act, 1994 was passed, the MSBs (Money Services Business) have to be registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the United States Department of the Treasury on a biennial basis.</p>
											<p class="top">In 2001, in an attempt to cope with the terrorist financing, the US Patriots Act expanded a federal regulation of the MSB, considered it as a federal crime to run a money transfer business without a money transfer license in any state that required such a license.</p>
											<p class="top">The court imposed an order to expand the concept of money transfer to include not only “a transfer of the actual money or currency”, but also “a transfer of the value of this currency through any other exchanger”.</p>
											<p class="top">The invention of Bitcoin in 2009 and a large number of the blockchain-based alternative cryptocurrencies have expanded both the benefits of these assets and the criminal interest for its using. In response, the FinCEN issued an explanatory guide for the virtual currency exchanges (the “FinCEN Guide”) on March 18, 2013.</p>
											<p class="top">The aim of the FinCEN Guidelines was “to explain the applicability of the rules implementation by the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) to persons that create, receive, distribute, exchange, accept or transfer virtual currencies”. It pointed two categories of participants in the cryptocurrency industry: "exchangers" and "administrators".</p>

											<p>The FinCEN's management concluded that the definition of a money transmitter does not distinguish the “real” and “virtual” currencies, “The acceptance and transmission of any value things in place of the currency, makes a person the money transmitter in accordance with the BSA regulations.”</p>

Benefits: Officially recognized currency, exchangeable at a fixed equivalent. Disadvantages: Less protected from the decentralization factors, compared to a cryptocurrency. It is controled from the states.</p>
											<p class="top">The earned crypto money is stored on the blockchain, an encrypted chain of the algorithms, that is divided into blocks, and stored on several computers at the same time. The principle of operation is similar to the files download programs, i.e. torrent.</p>
											<p class="top">For the last years, the popularity and demand for cryptocurrencies has caused a growing interest in the crypto industry. In order to establish the companies in this area, a crypto exchange / crypto wallet / ICO, a license is required.</p>

											<p>First of all, you should choose and check the name for your crypto company. After that, a package of documents, including a certificate of no criminal record, is required to identify the future owner. A legal address is necessary.</p>
											<p>The validity period is one year. It is followed by opening an account for a business, recruiting the employees, purchasing the software and technical equipment.</p>

											<p><strong>The Czech government's opinion about the crypto business in the Czech Republic</strong></p>
											<p>The Czech laws considers the digital currency not as a monetary unit, but as a product. A crypto business in the Czech Republic does not need a license, but it is possible to obtain a license for the international work with cryptocurrency – the EMI.</p>
											<p>Digital money is not subject to special taxes, but the VAT is charged on payments with cryptocurrency. Otherwise, a legal entity – the customer should pay the value added tax instead of his supplier.</p>

											<p>The CNB says that bitcoin is not a cashless currency. Accordingly, a cryptocurrency is a symbolic money that does not have a fixed value, in contrast to the officially recognized currencies.</p>
											<p>The bitcoins exchange is not a currency one, therefore, the CNB does not control the activities with cryptocurrency.</p>
											<p>The head of the currency control department of the CNB expressed the concern that the bitcoin will become a tool to bypass payment sanctions for online games. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance was asked to modernize the regulation about the control of gambling.</p>

									<div class="modal-section-title mb-3">What should be born in mind for registering <span>the cryptocurrency activities in the Czech Republic?</span></div>
									<p>With the high popularity and extensive use of cryptocurrency, it is not under the jurisdiction of the state. Moreover, the CNB imposed a ban on opening an account for crypto exchangers and crypto exchanges.</p>
									<p>Therefore, it is necessary to open the cryptocurrency accounts for companies outside the Czech Republic, in another jurisdiction.</p>
									<p>It is important to take into account the requirements of the Czech Ministry of Finance, according to which the cryptocurrency activities are impossible without verification of the identity of each participant in this process.</p>
									<p>The law obliges the sellers and buyers of a cryptocurrency in the Czech Republic to comply with the KYC and AMI standards strictly.</p>
									<p>The requirements are caused by the fear of the state about the number of the tax evaders, fraudulent activities in the field of finance and a terrorism.</p>
									<div class="modal-section-title mb-3">Options of Solution – <span>registration of a crypto exchanger in the Czech Republic</span></div>
									<p>An alternative option for a crypto exchanger / crypto exchange registration is other countries with more progressive terms.<br/><strong>For example:</strong></p>
									<ul class="marked-list-2 mt-0">
										<li>The UK – the cryptocurrency legislation have not been amended yet, but the state does not hinder a crypto activity in all forms. It is possible to withdraw the digital money into fiat money.</li>
										<li>Estonia – issues licenses for all existing operations with cryptocurrency.</li>
										<li>Malta – 3 regulations were recently adopted: on virtual financial assets, on innovative technologies and services, and on digital innovation operations (The Virtual Financial Assets Act, the VFA; The Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act; The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act. the MDIA).</li>
										<li>Luxembourg – issues the EMI licenses, that include all the ability for cryptocurrencies operations.</li>
										<li>Switzerland – depending on the project, it issues a license either the FINMA or the SRO.</li>
										<li>Belarus – issues licenses for crypto activities, but asks not to withdraw funds outside the country.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The Japanese crypto business is considered to be the leading and most expensive in terms of the number of government exchanges. An American license is specific and concretized for each separate type of activity with the digital money.</p>
									<p>Thereby, a state for registering a crypto business should be chosen extremely careful. Competent experts of the Acalista group will help you decide on the options.</p>
