                p Besides the banks, accounts in payment systems are also quite popular. A payment system is a financial entity that operates under a bank license. Such a payment system, just like banks, has the ability to issue the unique IBAN numbers, as well as make SWIFT payments. The payment systems, the same way as the banks, provide insurance for their clients' funds. That is, the payment system can be termed as a kind of bank analogue.

            strong.text-center.d-block.mt-2.mb-2 OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT FOR THE OFFSHORE COMPANIES/SCOTISH PARTNERSHIPS
            p Due to the difficult banking situation, related to the offshore companies, as well as Scottish partnerships, that are equate to offshore by more and more banks, our company offers such kinds of banks:
            ul.check-list.left
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100") Curacao – (completely remote) the deposit is 10 000 Euro. This deposit is not held, but the bank would like to see the same steady account balance.
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="150") Vanuatu – (completely remote) the deposit is 1 500 Euro, 1 thousand of which should be left like the required minimum on the account. They don’t undertake USD.
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="200") Belize – (completely remote) the deposit is 1 000 Euro. Provide the accounts in such currencies: USD, CAD, Euro, GBP and Swiss Francs.
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="250") Mauritius – (a bank has no restrictions for the companies, but requires a deposit of 10,000 Euros and holds it in the account).
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="300") Saint Lucia – (completely remote) the deposit of 5 000 Euro is held on the account. Accounts are available in USD, EURO
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="350") Dominica – (completely remote) intra-bank payment for an account opening – 3000 Euro. A customer gets the SWIFT and SEPA accounts.
            p Besides the banks, accounts in payment systems are also quite popular. A payment system is a financial entity that operates under a bank license. Such a payment system, just like banks, has the ability to issue the unique IBAN numbers, as well as make SWIFT payments. The payment systems, the same way as the banks, provide insurance for their clients' funds. That is, the payment system can be termed as a kind of bank analogue. 
            p Advantages:
            ul.check-list.left 
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100") short timelines of opening an account (up to 2 weeks)
              li(data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="150") lower rates, compared to the banks.

                          p Foreign organizations do not have to pay taxes on the territory of Dominica. However, you will certainly need to transfer the annually duty. The payment is made every year, but no later than the day of registration of a legal entity. If you do not follow this requirement within this time, the company will be expelled from the Register. However, the cost of the duty in Dominica is only $ 100, therefore, the  payment will not cost the Earth for the company owner.
                          p If you haven't paid duty in time, you can quickly and easily return the company to the Register. It is enough just to pay off the debt in duty and fines. Nevertheless, the name of the organization will have to be changed anyway. If you need to use a specific name, you can make re-registration of a legal entity with the same name.

Dominica has not  reached the same level of fame as Cyprus or Panama yet, but this offshore zone is also developing very quickly.

                          p The state has become an offshore zone due to the terrible economic situation, cased by the depletion of the main resource – phosphates. The legal base was formed earlier. 
                          p Offshore relations are regulated by legislation from 1992. The International Business Companies Act is the basis of the country's jurisdiction. At the same time, all conditions have been established for the formation and development of international corporations.
                          p There is the requirement of registration in the form of International Business Companies (IBC) in order to establish an offshore company within the jurisdiction. The establishment of a holding or a commercial corporation can take up to two days because the system is very flexible.
                        .tab-pane.fade#modcontent32
                          p The government has developed the most favorable conditions for offshore companies, however, any kind of fraud can be punished. If the company is suspected of this, it can be easily liquidated.
                          p Thanks to that, the country received recognition as an offshore zone. The jurisdiction allows the anonymous registration. Consequently, the founder can keep a low profile, entrusting the leadership to the formed staff.
                          p The regulation of corporate relationships is also envisaged. They are guided by the following acts:
                          ul.tab-list
                            li The Corporations Act (1972);
                            li The Insurance Companies Act (1974);
                            li The Bunking Act (1975).
                          p At the same time, there has been formed the authority that controls the implementation of the interaction norms prescribed in the legislation. The government has formed a group of 10 agents who control the activities of the corporations. As their powers are intertwined, agents often compete with each other.
                          p Some factors should also be attributed to features.
                          ul.tab-list(style="list-style: none")
                            li 1. The IBC's area of interest can include any activity that is not prohibited by law. However, certain areas require a license permition. These are banking, trust, insurance and reinsurance.
                            li 2. You can get a list of offshore registration in Nauru within two weekdays. In this case, the countdown begins from the moment the package of documents is submitted.
                            li 3. The name of the company can be registered in any language, but there must be an English translation. The originality of the name is also important.
                            li 4. A legal address in the jurisdiction is required for the IBC registration. This is a necessary requirement for receiving correspondence from the Nauru government agencies.
                            li 5. Both legal entities and individuals can be offshore managing director.You can choose residents from any country in the world. The same rules are for the shareholders. 
                            li 6. Foundation documents can be kept anywhere in the world.
                            li 7. The confidentiality of information about managers and shareholders is guaranteed in the jurisdiction. This information can only be accessed by a local court decision.
                            li 8. There are no restrictions on the choice of banks and  number of it. Confidentiality is ensured during transactions.
                          p The legislation allows offshore companies to issue their own registered shares, bearer shares. They can include par value or  exist without it. The founder or the meeting of shareholders  choose the currency for shares.
                          p You should also pay attention to certain restrictions in the selected offshore zone. The offshore companies in Nauru are prohibited from doing business with residents of the country. There is forbidding on owning of the real estate in the country. The IBC does not have the permission to participate in the offshore management.
                          p Services for resident institutions, that include the registered agent aid for international business companies have been prohibited. The jurisdiction forbits involvement of the resident companies to management or administration.

                          p The government provides a fairly loyal taxation system. The offshore companies are exempt from taxes such as:
                          ul.tab-list
                            li income tax;

                            li distributed income tax. 
                          p Therefore, the international corporation completely gets rid of double taxation.
                          p As for financials, there is also freedom of action.  Companies don't commit to lead or provide accounting or other types of reports.

                          p Malta has been a member of the EU since 2004. Thereafter, Malta is being on a course to become the center of the European business community. Its competitive tax treatment provides the lowest effective corporate tax rate in the European Union.
                          p In addition to tax incentives, investors appreciate English as the official language, the convenience of the EUR zone, professional accounting, and a corporate environment.

                          p A Maltese VAT company operates for the general trading purposes due to its unique tax treatment. If dividends are paid from a trading company to its non-resident shareholder, the shareholder is entitled to claim a refund at the tax rate of 35% paid by the company. 6/7ths of the tax amount is returned to the non-resident shareholder. As a result, the overall rate is reduced to 5%.
                          p The refunds are guaranteed and paid to shareholders by the Internal Revenue Department in 14 days after the application is submitted.

                          p Hong Kong is an autonomous territory on China's southern coast of the Pearl River and the South China Sea. It has an area of 1104 square kilometers. In the north, Hong Kong borders on the Special Economic Zone — Shenzhen in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
                          p Hong Kong's population is about 7,2 million people. Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. 
                          p Hong Kong had been governed by British jurisdiction until 1997. However, as a result of negotiations between China and the UK, Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China. That helps Hong Kong to become a special administrative region of China with a high degree of autonomy according to the principle: one country, two systems.
                          p The territory has turned to a major world trade and financial center. Being on the 45th stage in the World Economy Ranking, Hong Kong takes top 10 in GDP per capita.

                          p The offshore jurisdiction of Labuan is gaining popularity not just because of its advantageous geographical location, but also due to the most extensive list of treaties that exclude double taxation.
                          p At the moment, more than 60 banking institutions are registered in the state, as well as many insurance, leasing, trust firms. Bahasa (Malaysia) is the official language on the islands, but English is also widely spoken.
                          p The currency of Labuan is the ringgit, but it is not allowed to make a deal in the local currency for the offshore companies in most cases.
                          p State legislation provides an opportunity to register enterprises of various forms of organization with diverse degrees of responsibility. These two types of companies are the most profitable for the foreign investor:

                          p Closed-type companies are characterized by minimum permissible capital of 2 ringgits and maximum number of 50 shareholders. They are allowed to transfer shares to a third party (or several parties) in free form, as well as to issue credit funds to the directors or other firms.
                          p Moreover, organizations of this type are exempt from handing down the balance sheet of theirs activities in Malaysia.
                          p Open-type companies can also be registered on the state exchange and allow shareholders to transfer shares to third parties.
                          p However, the distinctive features of the open-type companies  are an unlimited number of shareholders and the minimum capital amount of 20 million ringgit, which must be paid in full by the time the company is registered. Such organizations are required to have auditors for reporting to the recorder authority in Malaysia.
                          p All types of companies registered in Labuan must have a package of documents, consisting of:
                          ul.tab-list
                            li Memorandum of Association;

                            li Protocol for Appointment of Director.
                          p Registration will take 2 weeks. You can also purchase an already registered company that can engage in any type of activity that is not prohibited by law.

                          p The typical offshore form is an ordinary international business company. In this case, we use the type of corporation, that is essential for international business activities and investments – the International Business company (IBC). 
                          p Law of Associations merged several acts that regulate the partnership and the system for the IBC operation, among them are:
                          ul.tab-list
                            li The Coordination Act (1990);
                            li The Corporations Legislation Act (1990);
                            li The Limited Liability Company Act (1996).
                          p There is only one possible type of the IBC – a local non-resident company, that is easy to set up and manage. The administration system is greately simplified because of the fact that the certain legal provisions are taken from the English system.
                          p Therefore, it is possible to hire an executive manager and a secretary. You can run a company locally or remotely from another country. All data on company operation should be kept in the main office, that can be located anywhere in the world. 
                          p At the same time, there is no need to prepare annual or other types of reports. Also, there is no taxation at all, that greatly simplifies the company activities.

                          p Subject to the implementation of the traditional law provisions , the IBC can be established in 1 day. However, it is necessary to comply with the terms that were prescribed for the name creation.

                          p The fundamental principle of taxation is the territorial principle. Income tax is imposed on an organization's income from sources located in Singapore, or a foreign income, received in a bank account, opened in Singapore.
                          p At the same time, dividends, income from the dealership and profits from services that are received outside the state, will be exempt from taxation if taxes on these incomes have been paid at a rate of at least fifteen percent in the country of origin.
                          p Futhermore, there is no capital gains tax in Singapore. The tax resident status will directly depend on the place where the organization is controlled and managed.
                          p Residents and non-residents taxation are the same, with the exception of the residents right of avoiding a double taxation according to the agreements, and exemption from taxes on income, received from the foreign sources; participation in a tax exemption program for a part of income received in the first three years of the organization's activity.
                          p The standard income tax rate is seventeen percent. Resident individuals whose income is up to one hundred thousand Singapore dollars per year (during the first three years of business) are exempted from paying income tax.
                          p For taxpayers whose income does not exceed two hundred thousand Singapore dollars per year, the rate of income is eight and a half percent. Nevertheless, the organization must have no more than twenty shareholders, ten percent of which are individuals. 
                          p The organization undertakes to submit the income tax returns  with the waybill documentation by December 1 of each following the fiscal year. 
                          p Moreover, all products and services provided in Singapore are subject to The Goods and Services Tax at a rate of seven percent.
                          p An organization must be registered as The Goods and Services Tax payer if its annual income has exceeded or is expected to exceed 1 million Singapore dollars.

                          p An important issue in the process of a companies establishment is income tax and other types of it. In this case, the Principality of Monaco provides a commercial activities tax, which is 33.5%. At the same time, the condition is met – deals outside the jurisdiction must come to at least 25% of the total corporation turnover.
                          p Companies that receive 75% of the profits from financial transactions within the territory of Monaco are completely exempt from taxation.
                          p As for a tax of 33.5%, there is one possibility that allows reducing the percentage to 10. Businessmen who maintain a small business in the jurisdiction, but receive large income outside it, can register most of it as wages. 
                          p Therefore, they exempt themselves from income taxes. However, this gap has already been noticed, and it is only a matter of time before it will be taken down.
                          p Trusts are the most attractive form of doing business in Monaco. Their advantageous taxation system makes its establishment very profitable. In the trust creation process, you must pay a percentage of the total managed property value.
                          p The number of beneficial owners directly influences the tax rate; it can be 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.7%. Also, the tax is reduced in the case of the trust managing that is located within Monaco. Futher, the annual tax will be 0.2% of the property value.

                          p The tax system in Latvia has many advantages that allow to define its jurisdiction as a low-taxed:
                          ul.tab-list

                        .tab-pane.fade#modcontent252
                          p Regarding the latest changes in the International and, especially, European legislation, the status of a company resident and the ownership of a VAT number are becoming the most important aspects of the trading companies work. More and more European partners prefer to cooperate with companies that have a VAT number.
                          p The quite simple procedure of the VAT number registration and automatically assigning of a tax resident status make the Latvian companies popular for trade within the EU, as well as for exporting goods outside the EU borders.
                        .tab-pane.fade#modcontent253
                          p It is possible to obtain a VAT number without losing the tax benefits in Latvia. The country is not at any black lists, moreover its legislation allows reducing the corporate tax rate. These circumstances make Latvian partnerships attractive for the foreign trade.
                        .tab-pane.fade#modcontent254
                          p The biggest advantage of Latvia over the traditional “holding” jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, Austria and Cyprus is its flexibility. There are no additional requirements of receiving the tax benefits in Latvia, such as the mandatory percentage participation, the duration of shareholding, nature of business, taxation level in the country of the subsidiary, etc.
                          p The EU Parent Subsidiary Directive allows the repatriation tax implementation at 0% tax rate for companies, registered in the European Union. Withholding tax is reduced on the basis of double taxation treaties signed by more than 50 countries, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.

                          strong Registration of a company in Andorra
                        p The specific feature of the Andorra legislation is the lack of possibility to buy a turnkey offshore company. It is not profitable and almost impossible. According to the laws of Andorra, the Articles of Association must describe the planned activities in the minute detail.
                        p All future operations are accurately spelled out and submitted to the authorities.
                        p This fact greatly distinguishes the country from other jurisdictions. In Andorra, it is impossible to start selling cars, and then hold a board of directors and switch to producing the computers under the same name of company. However, this country is great for a company registration.
                        p Despite the strict legislation for anti money-laundering, Andorra provides a good climate for doing business. Low taxes also have a positive effect on the company development. It is also important that the taxes in Andorra are fixed, easily calculated and predicted. It makes work and financial reporting much easier.
                        p The registration procedure is transparent, but requires learning the system. However, the Andorran laws impose a number of small requirements to the company. They are simple, but need some effort to fulfill them.
                        p Therefore, the best way to open a company in Andorra is to ask the specialists who will perform all the preparatory operations and simplify the registration procedure for the owner as much as possible.

                          strong The government does not intend to compete with the Seychelles or Belize in this controversial area in terms of the International law. The company you register with the Acalista group will be completely onshore but low taxed.

                          strong The Articles of Association can be changed or expanded, depending on the circumstances your business will meet. You can always add a new type of trading activity to your company list. But if a new company has a large number of activities in the charter, then the procedure for its approval can be visibly delayed.

                          strong Therefore, it's better to set the right balance. It is recommended to make the Articles of Association as broad as possible without the risk of delaying the approval procedure. A good decision is to buy a ready-made company with a local registration.

                          strong It is essential to certify the registration with a notary just after the Andorran authorities approve it. The notary will provide the Deed of Incorporation. This document will contain the names of all shareholders and information about the number of shares. All shares transactions must be certified by a local notary.

                          p According to the Andorran legislation, a resident of another country can have a total ownership of a trading company or a non-trading holding. But the Ministry of Commerce gives permission before the notary has completed the company registration if the foreign businessman is a shareholder.
                          p All in all, this procedure is formal. However, the status of all potential shareholders could be verified.

                          p However, a careful inspection is carried out to know the actual ultimate owner of shares. This is because Andorra leads a focused anti money-laundering activity.
                          p The legislation changes frequently and additional mechanisms of the control over the underground schemes are introduced. Therefore, it is better to contact the Acalista group specialists, who monitor all changes in laws.

                          p There is no PLC (Public Limited Company) concept in Andorra. There is a high probability that in the near future the legislation will make it possible to conduct business in this format. The specificity of a country is that there is no stock exchange.
                          p Therefore, all buying and selling operations are carried out in the private agreements form. The concept of business registration agents has also just emerged in the country.
                          p A company registered in Andorra can conduct commercial activities all around the world. The organization has become a resident of the country. 
                          p Andorra does not have a Central State Corporate Register. Therefore, verification of the company name uniqueness will take at least five days. Only then the registration procedure begins. Acalista group will help to register a legal entity without the visit to Andorra. You just need to certify a Power of Attorney for the lawyer of Acalista group.

                          p CORPORATE INCOME TAX (CIT): the tax refers to the actual profits distribution, mainly to the distributed dividends that have been distributed. The payable tax is 20/80 of the net income (20% of the turnover).
                          p INCOMING DIVIDENDS: The 5% rate applies when dividends are paid to a company (other than a partnership) that holds at least 10% of the company payer's capital; otherwise, the rate is 10%. Estonia does not impose an income tax on dividends.
                          p Capital gains tax (CGT): capital gains are considered as a regular income and are taxed by distribution. 
                          p Repatriation tax: since the Corporate Tax applies only to the distribution of profits, there is no separate withholding tax.

Estonia has been a member of the Eurozone since 2011. A special corporate tax system provides the payment of tax by limited liability companies only for the distribution of profits, i.e. the tax does not apply to accumulated retained earnings.

                        p But the most areas of investment are telecommunications and e-commerce. Moreover, the government, represented by the Sultan, supports foreign investment, promotes its attraction and expansion.
                        p Brunei becomes the center of an offshore business because of the sultanate's economy structure. However, the registration of a company has its percularities, that are familiar to the Acalista group specialists.

                          p Brunei is an ideal place for business establishment and development: the state offers comfortable conditions for both local businessmen and non-resident investors. Moreover, the country's currency is reliable and stable.
                          p There are four forms of business organizations in Brunei Darussalam, as well as in other countries. But there are some restrictions for the foreign investors. Therefore, a businessman from another country cannot conduct a private business in Brunei.
                          p Other forms (partnership, open-type and closed-type joint stock companies, a branch of a foreign company) do not have such prohibitions. For the partnership establishment, non-residents of the Sultanate must obtain a special permition from the Department of Immigration, Economic Planning and Development, as well as from the Ministry of Labor. 
                          p All companies are required to submit financial statements regularly, but an audit is not necessary. At the same time, there is no currency control. The taxation system is well-to-do for the foreign investors. They should not pay: 
                          ul.tab-list
                            li a duty;
                            li an income tax;
                            li a corporate tax;
                            li a stamp duty tax;
                            li a capital gains tax.
                          p However, a corporate income tax reaches 30%. But the resident companies pay tax on a whole income (received within and outside the country), and the foreign organizations – only on the profits earned within the jurisdiction.
                          p The main terms of the international business registration in Brunei: a local registered office and resident agent, closed access to reporting (confidentiality of data), information about the form of organization in the name, prohibition on the share capital payment in local currency (Brunei dollar), a local cityzen secretary.
                          p However, the director does not have to be a resident of the sultanate. Meetings can be held in any country. Another condition – the name of the organization should not contain the Cyrillic. Remarkably, the Brunei Darussalam authorities have signed an agreement with 12 countries to avoid double taxation.

                        p The LP is a Limited Liability Partnership managed by at least 2 partners: a General Partner and others – Limited Partners. 
                        p If a Canadian LP with non-resident members does not conduct business and receive an income in Canada, it is not taxed in Canada, in fact it is equal to an offshore company
                        p Canadian tax legislation does not treat LP as a separate subject of taxation. Founders ("Partners") must pay taxes on the income received by the LP company at their residence place, in proportion to their shares in LP, if this is provided by the legislation of that country.

                          p Brazil is famous for its rich coffee, the brightest carnivals and great football players. It is located in South America and is the only Portuguese-speaking state on the American continent. Brazil covers an area of 8,515,770 square kilometers, that is 5.7% of the entire land area of the Earth.
                          p Brazil is the largest state in South America, both territorially and in terms of population, that is 205,737,996 inhabitants. The state of Brazil is a federation that includes a federal district, 23 states and 3 territories.
                          p Brazil's economy has exceeded the development of other South American countries and has a special position in the global market. In 2004, Brazil stabilized the microeconomy by getting rid of debt and building up the foreign exchange reserves.
                          p Since 2008, the state has been an external creditor with investment status without any debts, according to the statement of two rating agencies. Sure, there were economic downturns in the period from 2008 to 2010, but Brazil coped with all the difficulties and came back to the ranking of the most prosperous countries.
                          p The state is one of the most profitable for the foreign investments due to the high interest rates and steady economic growth.
                          p The Brazilian capital increasing caused the rapid growth of the local currency, that forced the heads of government to raise taxes on some foreign investment. Because of the rational approach to financial management, Brazil has become a steady country in the global economy.
                          p Brazil is one of the most substantial countries in the developing world and has the largest economic potential among the Latin American countries.
                          p Therefore, a lot of the investors choose Brazil for conducting their business and opening offshore companies in the state. It is especially beneficial to establish an enterprise for the coffee production and transportation to other countries.

                        p.bottom The offshore banking activities were stopped from 2012 to 2015. The international banking functions are resumed now. Since 2012, the IRS in the United States has carried out a tight control for the offshore banks, closing small ones and imposing huge fines on large ones that could pay. The fines are still imposed on those who do not file the reports for the dollar accounts.
                        p.bottom As we know, the US Congress enact the Foreign Account and Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). It requires all international banks that deal with the US dollar to report the US dollar accounts holders each year. In practice, this fact has turned the offshore bankers into unpaid IRS agents.

                        p.top The presence of a forex broker license for a forex broker is the main criterion in choosing a forex broker for traders. Licenses show which regulator controls the company quality and activities. What information can a trader extract?
                        p.top For example, the license of the American futures regulator NFA controls one market, while the license for Antigua or Mauritius controls completely different market. There are a lot of regulators in the world that issue broker licenses for the forex activities with the important differences between them. Therefore, the trader should understand that the licenses issued by different regulatory authorities are not equal. That is why different forex licenses are rated differently in the forex broker rating. The most powerful forex broker licenses are awarded 100 points; licenses of the state bodies regulating the financial market are awarded 50 points; non-state self-proclaimed market regulators that have no influence on the forex brokers get 10 points.
                        p.top A forex broker's license is necessary, but not the only argument in choosing a broker and opening an account with his company. For choosing a broker, it is necessary to consider the whole range of criteria for the forex brokers rating. This is what the professional traders do.

                          strong about the Electronic Money Institution (EMI) — 
                          | an electronic money license for a company, registered in the UK.
                        p.bottom Depending on the turnover level, there are 2 options for registering an EMI license in the UK:
                          br
                          | — a classic EMI, in this case the fee (duty) to the FCA will be £ 5,000;
                          br
                          | — a small EMI (the monthly turnover should not exceed € 3,000,000; if the company do not conduct business — we will estimate according to the projections).
                          p.title Timelines of registration
                          p.bottom 3 months (if the regulator — FCA, do not have any questions about the submitted application);
                            br
                            | Up to 12 months (in case the FCA requests the additional documents).
                          p.bottom It should be noted that the electronic money application is being implemented in general in the international regulation sphere. The companies with the electronic money can effectively offer a number of banking services and services for the client funds holding, as a rule, these services are provided online (that implies a lot of risks). Therefore, this  well-organized application is just one step below the bank (if we consider this application as a financial instrument).
                        .hidden-text
                          p.bottom There are less requirements to the fund managers, stock brokers, depositories activities. For this reason, it is neccessary to know the features of the application (electronic money), all the key issues of the professional management and the attendant risks or problems and how to solve them asap.
                          p.bottom First of all, conducting an EMI business requires the appropriate education and knowledge to manage and obtain an EMI license. It means that:
                            br
                            | — The Senior Management must be experienced in organizing of such a type of company. This is an important fact for the FCA; persons with no experience in the field usually do not obtain a permission.
                            br
                            | — The company must be managed from the UK.

                      li If anyone moves to the UK with the intention of being a CEO, he should know the management rules, depending on the business model. Consequently, it may be necessary to appoint a local manager who has the competence to enforce the rules.
                      li The services provided by any third party — as well as IT support services — must be provided on the basis of a concluded contract.

                        p.bottom В нынешнем году в юридическом области игорной веб-индустрии на европейском континенте протекают серьезные изменения. Одна из основополагающих тенденций на сегодняшний день – это введение, практически, каждым из наиболее значимых государств Европы лицензирования.
                        p.bottom Большой спрос к этой сфере услуг дала постоянно увеличивающаяся популярность веббукмекеров и казино, которые основываются в Европейских и оффшорных юрисдикциях, в том числе в юрисдикциях Гибралтара, Мальты, Кюрасао, Коста-Рики.

                      | Букмекеров
                    p.dark «Пальма первенства» в ограничении персональных торговых площадок, безусловно, принадлежит крупнейшим странам Европы, а именно Испании, Италии, Франции, Великобритании.
                    p.dark Эти страны, начиная с 2000-х годов, стали организовывать финансовые учреждения, которые регулируют игорную активность в сети и блокируют вход на торговые площадки для оффшоровых операторов.
                    p.dark Благодаря нишевой позиции игровой веб-индустрии, Европа перестала пытаться ее контролировать на национальном уровне. Вот почему в разработке персональной законодательной базы теперь имеются еще и аутсайдеры. Например, нидерландское государство только в июле 2016 года смогло сформировать нужный законопроект.
                    p.dark И он вряд ли будет в силе с 2018 года. Кипр – это еще одна страна, которая поздно присоединилась к данной тенденции. Это островная красивая страна, которая приняла закон про регулирование игровой деятельности почти десять лет назад – в 2012 году.
                    p.dark Но полноценно регулировать деятельность букмекерских компаний в сети Кипр, в силу многочисленных факторов, стал пробовать только с 2016 года.
                    p.dark Для этих задач была специально создана такая организация, как Нацкомиссия по играм (National Betting Authority). Последняя сказала, что принимает решения выдавать лицензии веб-букмекерам, начиная с третьего октября 2016 года.
                    p.dark Многие туристы из стран Содружества независимых государств, которые приезжали отдохнуть на Кипр, не понаслышке знают, что среди киприотов крайне популярны всевозможные игры.
                    p.dark Почти на каждой магистральной улочке крупного городка здесь будет хотя бы парочка игорных организаций – помещения для игры в кено или бинго, пункты приема ставок букмекерских контор.
                    p.dark Еще совсем недавно на Юге Кипра, где власти более ответственно и серьезно контролируют игорный бизнес, действовал законопроект, который запрещал играть в казино.
                    p.dark Поклонникам таких развлечений приходилось переходить разделительную полосу и ехать в северную часть страны, чтобы попасть в один из центров казино (здесь игорный бизнес под контролем администрации Турции). Но этот запрет не так давно был снят – чтобы привлечь вкладчиков для построения интегрированного курорта по казино.
                    p.dark
                      strong Кипра интересуют финансово стабильные претенденты на лицензирование 
                    p.dark Ясное дело, что крайне высокая популярность игорного бизнеса – это один из основополагающих моментов, из-за которых законодатели поставили крайне высокую планку вхождения на торговые площадки.
                    p.dark Поскольку обязанность и условие сформировать уставной капитал в размере пятисот тысяч евро, с подкреплением гарантией от банковских учреждений тоже на пятьсот тысяч евро, это совсем немало не только по объемам государства с населением меньше одного миллиона человек. 
                    p.dark Это в пять-семь раз больше, чем на Мальте и в Великобритании – в лидирующих юрисдикциях.
                    .modal-section-title.text-center
                      span Лицензированные 
                      | платежные обязательства
                    p.dark Лицензированные платежные обязательства в тридцать тысяч евро за год за годовое лицензирование и сорок пять тысяч евро за двухгодовое лицензирование – не будет считаться низким. Прибавьте к этому еще и игорное налогообложение в тринадцать процентов от валовой игорной доходности.
                    p.dark Десять процентов от налоговой ставки, непосредственно, будет отправлено в казну. Остаток в три процента будет разделен между фондами, которые поддерживают спортфедерации и фонды, которые предотвращают и лечат игорную зависимость. 
                    p.dark Регулятор, который поставил такие немалые условия, дает очень точный сигнал того, что Кипр интересуется исключительно финансово стабильными претендентами на лицензирование.
                    p.dark В число подобных претендентов, логично, что попадают и большие региональные операторы наземного букмекерства. Кроме того, выше обозначенные условия не составляют проблемы для глобальных лидерующих представителей в интернет-области.
                    p.dark Так получится ли у Кипра привлекать лидирующих операторов и лицензирование в государства, повторив прошлый удачный опыт в региональном объеме Мальты, другого средиземноморского активно развивающегося островновго государства?
                    p.dark Наша компания придерживается осторожного мнения на этот счет и имеет в этом плане оптимистические позиции.
                    p.dark С одной стороны, кроме большой цены, лицензирование еще ограничивается по линейке продукции. Создатели законодательных актов предпочитают «убрать» не только игровую линейку казино, но еще и такие типы спотставок, как спортставки на собачьи и лошадиные забеги, спрэд-бэттинг.
                    p.dark Кроме того, регуляторы выдвигают требование применять веб-ресурс конкретно с доменом — .com.cy
                    p.dark Но, кроме таких существенных недочетов, в противовес, можно назвать и суперважные благоприятствующие элементы. Согласно приходящего информационного потока, комиссия обладает широкими источниками для стремительного рассматрения четко выполненных заявок от профессиональных фирм.
                    p.dark Наиболее положительное оценивание – от пары недель до выдачи предварительного одобрения, что намного быстрее других юридических фирм.
                    p.dark Кроме того, НКБ не выдвигает требования о создании полноценной инфраструктуры серверов операторов на кипрском полуострове. На самом деле, хватит всего лишь и одного сервера, чтобы контролировать регуляторскую деятельность.
                    p.dark Но, возможно, самое основное достоинство, в этом случае, – это лингвистическая и геополитическая характеристика и особенность Кипра. В Республике Кипр законодательством признается три языка – греческий, турецкий и английский.
                    p.dark То есть, местное островное лицензирование – это, возможно, наиболее мудрое решение при избрании операторов, которые ориентируются на рынке близлежащих государств с соответствующими языками. С точки зрения репутации, кипрский остров обладает узнаваемыми характеристиками для аудиторий части восточной стороны Средиземного моря.
                    p.dark Кроме того, появление в странах Европы официально прошедших лицензии турецкоязычных веб-сайтов – это, возможно, еще один привлекательный момент для поклонников азартных игр из масштабной диаспоры Турции в странах западной Европы.
                    p.dark Безусловно, Кипр и не сможет обеспечивать сотнями лицензирование, как сейчас это делает Мальта.
                    p.dark Но, вероятно, изначально таких планов и не было. Наверное, основная задача запуска – это привлекать несколько сотен стабильных и профессиональных операторов для финансово счастливого запуска в регионе и в самом государстве.

                        span legalization in Denmark
                    p.dark The history of illegal gambling in Denmark is quite long. In the post-war period, it was easier to monopolize all possible types of gambling than to fight them. In 1948, the Danske Spil company was created for this. This brand has existed to that end.
                    p.dark Though, the slot machines was allowed in the entertainment places, the game was provided only for the conditional monetary units.
                    p.dark Later, at the turn of the 70s and 80s of the twentieth century, there was a large number of clandestine gambling organizations, that were available only for trusted people. Such places were usually located in bars.
                    p.dark An interesting fact is that in the clandestine gambling places the game was for matches or pieces of paper, that were later exchanged for cash, according to the specially established pay tables.
                    p.dark After the legislation had taken another step towards  liberalizing gambling in 1990, the demand for clandestine organizations was redused.
                    p.dark The amendments to the current legislation provided opportunities for the admission of the casino operators from a number of European countries (Germany, Austria, the Netherlands). However, the activities in Denmark need obtaining a license and compliance with the extremely strict requirements.
                    p.dark One of the regulations that the requirements included, was the creation a joint venture with a resident from Denmark by a foreign agent. Due to this fact, the gambling organizations have started to placed in the hotels, that operate as partners.
                    p.dark With the Internet development, a large number of online casinos have appeared with the full tools in the form of games and bets. As this business sector began to grow rapidly, the government faced the need for legislative regulation of it.
                    p.dark One of the first steps was the ban on the foreign companies activities in territories controlled by the Danish jurisdiction in 2003. Online casino operators were quite often registered in countries with a freer market in terms of government control.
                    p.dark Therefore, the Danish banks were forced to refuse servicing the credit cards, that were used to pay for services in the online gambling organizations.
                    p.dark When such initiatives were appeared in Danish legislation, it has caused a negative reaction from the European Union. The disagreement between local requirements and European institutions has been worsened since Denmark ratified the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in 2008.
                    p.dark For the status quo resumption, there were made changes in the existing legislation on the gambling business in 2010. The applying started in 2012.
                    p.dark One of the initiatives was the Danske Spil's legal deprivation of gambling monopolization and de facto the access of the foreign agents to the local market. The state retained the right for the state lottery, bingo game, lottery scratch cards, bets on horse, dog and pigeon races.
                    p.dark The private companies have got the right to engage in such gambling activities as slots, betting and online casinos.
                    p.dark However, in 2014, a number of amendments were adopted. It has significantly tightened the legislation against the foreign operators. First of all, both operators and distributors of casino software, according to the new amendments, were obliged to be tested and licensed in Denmark.
                    p.dark The online casinos owners from abroad were obliged to pay tax in the amount of 20% of income to the Danish budget.

                    p.dark The poker, especially an online game, has been popular in Denmark for quite a long time. This popularity is caused by the success of Copenhagen resident Gustav Hansen, a professional poker player. The amount of a prize money he had gotten for over 10 years of playing was almost $ 10 million.

The first one, The Danske Lotteri Spil, covers the lottery segment (Lotto, Keno, Eurojackpot), Bingo lotto, accepts bets on Dantoto equestrian sports and organizes Quick scratch cards.

                        p.dark In many ways, such a high popularity of this sports competition is caused by Denmark's proposal to host the first stage of the Tour de France on its territory.

It is forbidden to involve celebrities in the advertising campaigns. They must also provide information in such a way that a potential consumer can adequately assess their chances of winning.
                      li Control over the financial activities. During the licensing process, a primary control is carried out, however, additional checks can be conducted at any time. The taxes on gambling business are quite high in Denmark. There are two types of taxes – an income tax for operators (45% for the first 4 million Danish kroner, then 75% is paid, for online establishments – 20%) and a corporate tax, that is 25% of the rest.
                      li Distribution of funds received as a result of state licensing and taxation. Funds are often refferred to sports and cultural programs.
                    p.dark If we take into account the breacking of the state monopoly on all types of gambling business, a detailed study of statistics shows that organizations, controlled by state bodies, still have been having a greater sphere of influence on the gambling services market in comparison with the private companies.
                    p.dark The segment of the market, directly or indirectly controlled by the state, is 62%.

                        p There are two types of licenses in Cape Verde: a municipal license and an activity license. A municipal license is compulsory for all businesses that are operating in Praia. An inspection is usually carried out before the granting of a municipal license.
                        p However, since the Decreto-Lei of 30/2009 has been adopted, an inspection of the municipality can be carried out a posteriori and an enterprise can start its activities before receiving the municipal license.
                        p The license can be checked online through the following web portal:

                          strong An activity license, 
                          | as the name implies, is obtained for the activity that the company is going to carry out. This license is optional for all companies. For example, if a commercial company does not conduct the export-import activities, there is no need to obtain such a license.
                        p If a company applies for two licenses at once, the inspection of the Municipality is carried out by two inspectors.

Here, registration is much cheaper than in Britain, the United States, Switzerland or Singapore. So, a license for opening a virtual currency exchange office in the country is much more affordable than in the mentioned.
                      li Timelines. It takes a minimum time from the submission of documents for registration to obtaining a license. If everything is prepared correctly, the duration of the procedure will be not more than one and a half months.
                      li The Laws. Licenses for exchange operations can be obtained quite legally. Since December last year, the using of cryptocurrencies for business has been available to everyone. This is called a "virtual value". In addition, there are conditions in which a token will be qualified as securities. There is the less probability that the regulator will consider the token as a security in Estonia, than in Singapore or the United States. That is why Estonia is so popular for opening an ICO.
                      li A regulator. Cooperation with regulators, as well as access to them, can be an important factor in any blockchain project. Therefore, coollaboration with the Financial Supervision Authority and other financial regulators in Estonia is much easier than in the States and Singapore.

                        p.top Cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore. In recent years, Singapore has been one of the countries with the largest financial investments in the cryptocurrency market. This is due to the fact that the Singaporean legislation is one of the most loyal to the virtual currencies business.
                        p.title Legal position of the authorities
                        p.top Over the recent years, the cryptocurrency exchanges development in Singapore has intensified. Therefore, the Singapore Monetary and Financial Authority (MAS) was forced to express its position on this matter many times, as well as to explain some legal rules.
                        p.top The MAS was loyal to the companies that deal just with the exchange of virtual currencies, since their activities can be carried out without a government licensing in Singapore.
                        p.top At the same time, the companies that have conducted the ICOs and are involved in transactions with securities (most often with the digital tokens) are required to obtain an appropriate Singapore license, since the sphere of securities circulation is clearly regulated in Singapore by a special regulation.
                        p.top So, as long as the activities of the intermediary company in Singapore do not treat with the securities market, but just exchange the virtual currencies, no licenses are required. Such attitude of financial management attracts cryptocurrency entrepreneurs from various countries.

                        p A token is not always equated to securities, and therefore, the rules of the securities exchange do not always apply to its sale. However, in order to operate legally, it is important to know in what cases digital tokens act as securities.
                        p The token is distributed to attract loans. In this case, the digital tokens are prove of the company debt that put the tokens to their holders. The token is an equivalent to a loan.
                        p Digital markers are placed on the platform to attract investors. The holders of tokens are able to participate in the company management, as well as to get profits from its activities. In this case, the token is equated to shares.
                        p These examples are the most common, but this list can be updated.

                        p.top Since the Money Laundering Control Act, 1994 was passed, the MSBs (Money Services Business) have to be registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the United States Department of the Treasury on a biennial basis.
                        p.top In 2001, in an attempt to cope with the terrorist financing, the US Patriots Act expanded a federal regulation of the MSB, considered it as a federal crime to run a money transfer business without a money transfer license in any state that required such a license.
                        p.top The court imposed an order to expand the concept of money transfer to include not only “a transfer of the actual money or currency”, but also “a transfer of the value of this currency through any other exchanger”.
                        p.top The invention of Bitcoin in 2009 and a large number of the blockchain-based alternative cryptocurrencies have expanded both the benefits of these assets and the criminal interest for its using. In response, the FinCEN issued an explanatory guide for the virtual currency exchanges (the “FinCEN Guide”) on March 18, 2013.
                        p.top The aim of the FinCEN Guidelines was “to explain the applicability of the rules implementation by the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) to persons that create, receive, distribute, exchange, accept or transfer virtual currencies”. It pointed two categories of participants in the cryptocurrency industry: "exchangers" and "administrators".

                        p is a person or organization "engaged in the business of exchanging the virtual currency for the real currency, funds, or other virtual currency." A virtual currency administrator is a person or organization "engaged in business for issuance the virtual currency (putting into circulation) and has the right to buy back (withdrawn from circulation) such virtual currency."
                        p The FinCEN's management concluded that the definition of a money transmitter does not distinguish the “real” and “virtual” currencies, “The acceptance and transmission of any value things in place of the currency, makes a person the money transmitter in accordance with the BSA regulations.”
                        p Therefore, the exchangers and administrators are money transmitters that must be registered as the MSBs (unless they fall into the exception).
                        p As the registered MSBs, these businesses are subject to the certain additional requirements under the BSA and its executive rules and must develop the safe anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs.

                    p The federal government currently relies on powers under the 18 U.S.C. §1960 and the FinCEN guidance to monitor the cryptocurrency projects that are illegal.
                    p Over the past two years, an increasing number of criminal complaints have been filed against the operation of unlicensed cryptocurrency MSBs in violation of the 1960 section. The Justice Department has started the cases in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, New York and Ohio.
