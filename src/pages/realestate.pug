                  p Real estate yield is higher than that of other financial instruments (government and corporate bonds and deposits). Additionally, real estate yields may be comparable to or even higher than stock yields
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent2
                  p Shares and bonds may lose their value completely. With real estate, this can only happen if the building has been completely destroyed or the location becomes uninhabitable.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent3
                  p Volatility is an indicator that characterizes the mutability of price. The volatility of real estate is lower than that of other financial instruments because real estate transactions are conducted in the private market and are less liquid.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent4
                  p Income from bonds and shares is fully subject to income tax. Real estate makes it possible to deduct depreciation from the tax base, while the market value of the real estate object does not change.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent5
                  p Normally, real estate follows inflation. Standard lease agreements provide for annual indexation, which may be expressed as a fixed percentage or equal to the consumer price index. When selling apartments, the price, with stable demand, grows with inflation.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent6
                  p Investment in real estate has potential for value growth through possible improvements (e.g., renovation, new construction, or management optimization). The value of real estate changes during market cycles. Thus, the time of selling is a key aspect of value maximization for an investor.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent7
                  p Investments in commercial real estate usually involve stable cash flows in the form of leases, which are distributed through dividends on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.
                .tab-pane.fade#modcontent8
                  p If bank loans were used to finance the real estate object, rental income will help to service the debt payments. They will reduce the debt burden and thus increase the equity capital, which the investor floats at the time when the real estate object is sold. With financing cheaper than using equity capital, the investor will be able to earn some money thanks to the difference between the cost of the equity and debt capitals.

                  .description Among the potential investors who want to obtain a second citizenship or a residence permit by the purchasing of a real estate, Cyprus is now at the top. Why? Because Cyprus is a part of the European Union. For example, If you buy the real estate in Turkey or Montenegro, you will get a residence permit for a year for the whole family almost immediately. In Cyprus, the same conditions apply in the case of buying any property costing 300 thousand euros or more. But this is a residence permit in a country of the European Union, and with it, you can travel around Europe without visas. There are great opportunities. And if you receive permanent residence in Cyprus, even more opportunities are waiting for you. And if you have a lifetime permanent residence, you will only need to visit Cyprus once within two years. That is, the island doesn't create any terms for you.
